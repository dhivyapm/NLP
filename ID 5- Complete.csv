How tall is he? 
"Damn, what happened to you? "
[inaudible 00:01:11] Is he good though? Is [inaudible 00:01:16] like that like that? 
"[inaudible 00:01:24] entire team is not like that, though. "
"Yo, see. [inaudible 00:01:31] He's only on there because he's 6'2"". "
"[inaudible 00:02:03] I remember we played them in state. Bro, they [inaudible 00:02:06] us. [inaudible 00:02:08] We were supposed to play them. [inaudible 00:02:11] "
[inaudible 00:02:15] 
You know [inaudible 00:02:25] right? 
Our quarterback. 
Huh?

UNCC. 
"Oh, yeah. You told me. "

Do you [inaudible 00:02:55] 
That's my boy. 
"[inaudible 00:02:55] What are you doing, bro? "
Why? 
[inaudible 00:03:40] 
We learning. 
What the [crosstalk 00:03:48] 
"Damn, bro [inaudible 00:04:01] "
"Think about like freshman doesn't [inaudible 00:04:08] but he's fucking 14, my nigga. "
[crosstalk 00:04:14] a giant. 
Did someone put some [crosstalk 00:04:17] 
Give him your arms. 
That's what I'm saying. Give him your arm. Chop them shits off. You could be like a... Who's that dude from that place [inaudible 00:04:31] that 77? 
[inaudible 00:04:33] 
"Yeah, whatever. He's going to be him. "
"Well, that's [inaudible 00:04:52] teammate. That ain't his teammate, but he just a 77 dude there. "
Damn. [inaudible 00:05:37] feeling themselves. 
Coby White playing his heart out. 
"[inaudible 00:06:17] throwing that down, bro? "
[inaudible 00:06:41]
Why you put circle in the print line? 
"So, you can create all the methods... "
[crosstalk 00:09:05] 
"So, it's not that [inaudible 00:09:06] method [inaudible 00:09:15] "
It's not going to run shit. 
Yeah. 
She a asshole. 
Just a [inaudible 00:09:39] 
I was [inaudible 00:10:49] What are you laughing at? 
What? Talk. 
What did I do? 
"So, [inaudible 00:11:21] because when you actually got to do it, it's like, [inaudible 00:11:23] "
"Yeah, but it's nice to know it. More opportunities. "
"Wait, was it supposed to be called project one? "
Program one? Act like you're doing something. [inaudible 00:12:33] at the end of the semester. 
"I said, ""I guess [inaudible 00:12:36] at the end of the semester."""
[inaudible 00:12:51] No. You a doodoo ass [inaudible 00:13:01] 
[inaudible 00:13:09] There goes my grade. 
I don't know how to do this shit. I'm gone. [inaudible 00:14:22] 
"What were the shapes, again? Square... "
What? 
Yeah. 
No. [inaudible 00:15:37] 
Or whatever squared. 
Yeah. 
[inaudible 00:15:55] a question. 
"You see, for this, how it has to take in the user's input? "
Right here. For the assignment two. 
I have to put in a capital letter. How do I do that? I don't think this is right. 
"Well, I mean, I didn't know if it has to be, but in the assignment sheet... "
[inaudible 00:16:22] 
"No, but like you see how it says [inaudible 00:17:16] that has this? [inaudible 00:17:18] says this, but then, down here, [inaudible 00:17:20] run sampler. It shows this, right? "
"Oh, it doesn't say it has to be capitalized. [inaudible 00:17:29] correct? "
Whatever this is. 
What's the zero mean? 
Why? It's one [inaudible 00:18:08] 
"So, when you're trying to take the user's input, it doesn't matter whether it's capitalized or not? "
"But like, does that matter? "
I have a question. 
"Oh, okay. Fine. [inaudible 00:18:44] "
"This is for assignment two, but do the user's input have to be capitalized? "
Cool. 
"Bitch, I'm getting tired of these damn flow charts. "
What do we have to use next year?
What's that? 
Genius. 
What is that? 
What the fuck? It's kind of like a flow chart. 
No. 
How many [inaudible 00:21:11] score? How many points did [inaudible 00:21:11] score? 
[inaudible 00:21:11] 
"[inaudible 00:21:18] ugly, bro. Look at him. "
He had 29. 
He has seven for nine from three. 
You see some high school kid did a windmill and put his elbow in the [inaudible 00:23:12] 
Some random kid. 
"So, what you use? Copy and past the same for the rest? And just change the numbers in the formula? "
"I was going to do [inaudible 00:24:00] for the first, [inaudible 00:24:01] "
[inaudible 00:24:20] 
"David's not here, is he? "
[inaudible 00:24:27] 
It's more professional. 
[inaudible 00:25:34] 
Does it have to be? 
[inaudible 00:26:05] 
Pretty sure it's AU. 
UA? 
"What the fuck is wrong with this thing, then? Why does it say I'm doing it wrong? "
There's only two places where I spelled square. 
"These computers just hate me, bro. What's wrong with this thing, now? "
Yeah. 
[inaudible 00:28:36] 
[inaudible 00:28:41] can be either an uppercase or a lowercase. 
What's wrong with this thing now? 
It's being stupid. 
"I thought this was still in the main method, though. "
I thought this was still in the main method. 
"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So, like-"
"-isn't this code different? Here, you put that in there, and it worked. "
See how you put it in here? 
Yeah. 
Oh. 
"Wait, so this a whole nother thing, so it's down here, right? "
"Oh, no. It's right here. "
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
It's ?r². 
Genius. 
Hype me up right quick. [inaudible 00:31:14] 
"Said, ""Hype me up right quick. I'm [inaudible 00:31:16] "
"R A D I U S. What the fuck is this, man? "
Genius. 
Swear that's how you spell square. 
"Oh, that is how you spell square. "
12
I'll be back. I got to get [inaudible 00:32:16] I'm 12. 
"Yo, I'm back. Yo. "
I was trying to talk to [inaudible 00:33:38] My name's [inaudible 00:33:45] She's going to be looking at this thinking we're retarded. 
"You can add... No, don't do squared, bro. Just multiply it by itself. "
You have to do math pal function. 
"Mm-hmm (affirmative) Yo, did you bring us any pie on pie day? "
"Oh, shit. "
"[inaudible 00:35:18] Damn, somebody's collarbone broken. "
[inaudible 00:35:25] Dude. You call me when I'm in class every single day. [inaudible 00:35:45] crack? 
When did I leave? 
"Idiot calls me in class every day, bro. "
"So, that's the code? "
Why? It's it one half base times [inaudible 00:37:35] 
Just put in point 5. 
[inaudible 00:37:55] Who told this shit to switch? 
"So, I have three different desktops open, but like [inaudible 00:38:04] switched with this. So, if I would've turned this way or that way, the game would've pulled up. When [inaudible 00:38:12] walked by [inaudible 00:38:13]"
"[inaudible 00:38:26] works with like a nine million guy group, bro. What part of separate yourself does it not understand? "
All right. Come on. I'll teach you how to do this. 
"All right. Fine. Bro, come on. Hurry up. Yo, deuces. "
"No, we're [inaudible 00:39:15] "
Come on. This is going to take like two minutes. 
"Nah, we're still working. "
It wasn't comfortable. 
It is [inaudible 00:39:28] right? 
"Okay, cool. [inaudible 00:39:33] you wouldn't have heard everything I said, then. "
"All right, so, where we at down here? What is the length? Copy and paste that. All right, if you want do that that now. [inaudible 00:40:01] Yo, you killing it, bro. Oh. Okay. I change that to width. Wait, no, no, no. What is this, a triangle?"
"Oh. Length times width. Coding kind of easy if you know what you're doing, bro. Like, dummy easy. Like, this shit looks so simple right now. "
"Don't bring that up, bro. "
Two minutes. 
"All right, but I can do that. She said she's extending it. "
One half [inaudible 00:41:38] 
"Base and height, and then divide by two [inaudible 00:41:48] "
Height. 
"It's height, bro. They just did some dumb shit. "
"You just type in what is your base, what is your height? His neck is all kinds of fucked up, bro. Every time he turned it's a [inaudible 00:42:13] "
Yo [inaudible 00:42:23] his shit crazy. 
"Yeah, I was worried. "
"I don't want his neck to fall off, you know? "
"Well, if you put it that way... [inaudible 00:42:43] doubled and a thing, and then a system print out, then... [inaudible 00:42:50] height? Base to height, then double area. I mean, yeah, yeah, double area. Then base times height. One half, you forgot the one half. Can you put another parenthesis? Because I'm pretty sure it's one half everything. "
"No, because there's still a one half. It's one half base times height. Okay, yeah, it does that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"Let me know what numbers you put in, bro. "
"All right, let's do five and six, all right? "
"Five, six, divided by two... [inaudible 00:43:56] it should be 15. "
You guys missed the Queen City Hackathon. That one was huge. They like take us [inaudible 00:44:08]
Yeah. 
It's not the Queen City one. 15? 
Yes. Because I went to it. 
"No, like two or three weekends ago. "
"Where is it at? All right, see, this was a... "
What is it? What was the other thing? 
How do you do that? 
"So, it takes like two seconds? "
[inaudible 00:46:01] 
"Wait, Sarah gives you the answers, though. Your choice. "
"Chris will say some bullshit, though. Sarah will be like, ""Okay. Here you go."" "
"Hey, Chris. "
"Yeah. I just want the answer, bro. "
"[inaudible 00:47:15] over here, now? "
[inaudible 00:47:30] she would've been doing half the code for us right now. 
She trying to bop quick. 
"I couldn't pause it. No, we not pausing it. Yo, we still running, right? Oh, the time not counting. Oh, yeah it is. Yeah, it is. The battery about to die, though. Tell me the battery not about to die. Up at the top right. "
"Yo, you need to charge this. "
Why'd you turn it off? 
"Should I get [Tara 00:48:24], bro? [inaudible 00:48:34] my [inaudible 00:48:37] Tell me [inaudible 00:48:40] bro. "
Killing this [inaudible 00:48:47] 
[inaudible 00:49:35] 
(singing) I'm singing [inaudible 00:49:36] 
[inaudible 00:49:39] 
"Hold on, hold on. How far are you guys [inaudible 00:49:46] Hold up. Don't listen. "
"Rapping [inaudible 00:50:06], bro. "
"I got you, bro. "
"You're literally retarded, bro. I did a flow chart [inaudible 00:51:04] "
"Yo, we out. "
"Yo, Chris. I don't know how to stop [inaudible 00:51:34] "










All right.

"I don't know, dude."
How do you pronounce her last name?

"No, bruh, I'm tryna say her full name. That's why I asked you how you say it."
Why would you not know? How do you say your last name?
Did you just break it?
How do you pronounce her last name?
"Test, test."
I think Sarah would do it better. I think Sarah would be more funnier with it.

You fucked it up (laughing) you fucked it up.

Maybe Nathan will like it.
"5a is empty array, right?"
"No, that's one."
Bruh.
Do it for your mom. We finished the first one.
He sent me a picture. Here.
"Ay bruh, get back on. Get back on. "
"I saw that yellow thing on there, you didn't even open it."
There's a little notification thing that you didn't open up in the corner.
This little nigga dirty.
Hm?
Accidentally yeah.
Perfect.
I'm impatient. Took you a hot minute. Josh.
Josh.
The realest bruh. The first one true nigga.
How are they different after?
After a line is compiled
Return array.
Last one.
"Oh wait, which array?"
To the exact sentence...
Spell reference.
You know I was a spelling bee champion.
All right.
"Wait, we got two points. "
I did it.
"It's worth zero points. Oh you, you messed up."
[crosstalk 00:18:02]
Across two...
"Chill bruh, chill, chill, chill. (laughs)"
What good is a Mac if you ain't gonna use it to its full potential?

He sent them six but they're loading.
Loading?
Loading.
He sent the whole god damn file.
He sent them through iCloud.
Bruh. Refresh. 
"Hey do you still have the first thing? Hey hey, Thomas, tell them we'll give them the quiz if they do the code."
"Sod, sod. [crosstalk 00:21:22]"
You do the second one?
I could get a quiz if you give me the code.
Huh?
I'll give you quiz 2. Start the code.
Lowkey love being the middleman.
'cause I get everything and no one gets shit. (laughs)
"We did it from him. We get the quizzes from him, get the code from him, and then switch... flip-flop em. Middleman always does the dirty work."
"Ooh, he's sending them again. Hotmail? Miss Drick? Hell no."
Bruh did he send them?
He sent them individually? Oh hell no.
"Reference, same. For the first one."
Same.
"Wait, come back!"
(laughs) Did you take a picture of that?
"Ten, five, six."
He should go fuck me up.
"One two three, not in the scope."
[crosstalk 00:24:58]
"Goddamn. Ten, two. False, true."
"Eleven, five."
Take it just like that.
"Increase mine, increase theirs. Wait hold on, I'll show you. Where does it say ""Increase mine, increase theirs""?"
"Copies the reference, the values of this too."
"Damn, nigga you... you did that quick."
Make a copy of the past. You ready?
Aye.
"Yeah, yeah yeah."
Yeah.
"Told you, they don't got money stuck. Where the gold at bro? Yo, yo. "
(laughs)
[crosstalk 00:27:54]
"You know what's great about that? I sent that to Ethan. Now we have Ethan in our pocket too. So whenever you need Ethan, we're hitting that line."
What'd you say?
You said [Vetsimo 00:28:45] some shit like that. Sounded like.
"Yo, tell him to rapido, bruh. Rapido, bruh, let's go. I'm tryna go home. He capping, he not gonna give it to us."
Hm?
Christopher.
Hell No. Sarita! Where's Sarita?
Where's David?
Where is Sarita?
"Oh, Sarah!"
Five.
Whoo. 
[David 00:00:15] smokes weed and smokes crack. Not my name. [Morgan 00:00:31] does drugs too. [Sud's 00:00:39] an addict. He's not even paying attention. 
"Hit the gym, boss man. "
Idiot.
"Oh, shit. "
But we ain't even started.
"Okay. So, this is an index of eight, right? This is a minus 1-0."
It's better than typing the whole shit out. 
"Yo, like real shit, you my dog. But if you sick, you better back down now. "
"Hell, no. "
"What is it, searching? "
And then... 
"I don't know yet. What is that, six as an index?"
David's a liar. 
You finished?
"Yeah, of course."
I know.
What the fuck is this? 
Well it's the same thing I'm doing.
What's up with 10?
What's up with 10?
You get 10?
[crosstalk 00:10:28].
What number are y'all on?
Ten.
I think we're on nine.
"Don't ask him. Don't even... don't you dare come over here. Bro, how many so far [inaudible 00:12:17]? Scroll up to nine."
"Skip 10, and then binary. And then... and page 260."
Yeah. How many times she going to check? She's worried about her research. Fuck y'all research.
Huh?
It's fine.
He was getting a bucket.
Well let's get [Sarah 00:13:34]. Sarah?
But I got a question. I don't know what's wrong with this dude. 
The textbook says there is.
I'm throwing that textbook away then.
"Cool. Oh, another question."
I don't know a single one of these.
"I know it's binary research, but it's like... I'm not... I'm lost on this."
Genius.
[inaudible 00:16:10] 53.
Thirty-three?
"You want to guess, boss."
That's what I said.
One.
Why? Why?
I don't know why it's wrong.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
This.
Why?
It's the middle one.
You're on a roll. Do you know this one?
Six.
So it's easier when someone else tells me the answer.
All right. I really don't know this one.
Since [Ikey 00:18:34] is less than A-mid... this one.
No. I thought this one was the right answer.
"Wait, but is it right?"
Okay.
I think this one.
"Oh, no, this one, this one."
Genius. 
"Fine, you can be the genius."
"I did, with the help of you and [Skylar 00:19:15]."
"Dude, I really just guessing and then waiting for her to go, ""Whoo."" All right, bouncers, did y'all get number 10? Hey? Hey, [Sahai 00:19:47]? Sahai, did y'all get 10?"
Did y'all get 10?
"All right. Since we've given you number 10, give us the rest."
"All right, here. "
Sahai?
Sahai?
"Sahai, did you get it? Yes, sir. All right, now give us the rest. Oh, I need your help. David?"
"Big guy. So I still don't know this one, and I definitely don't know this one."
Because I don't know it.
Eighty-eight.
"[crosstalk 00:22:02] Oh, my God, this one. Look at this one. I have attempted this one 16 times."
[inaudible 00:22:15] TA in first class or this one.
"Duh, bro, come on. Do you know how to do this one? [crosstalk 00:22:40]. "
Okay. Nevermind then. My brother said it was a bitch too. He said it was literally the hardest.
I don't pay attention.
What did you end with?
Yeah.
Oh.
This test.
"Oh, what makes it worse is I don't do homework either."
"Yeah, my homework [crosstalk 00:23:29]."
"Yeah, but I don't know how to do them. I'm asking for help. [crosstalk 00:23:39]. I have an 87 in there. "
[crosstalk 00:23:46]. 
What's this guy doing in here? 
That's another TA. He's one of the head TA's. He's got a crazy name. What's his name? 
"Oh, they're fine. Tell me that's not a crazy name. Never heard of that shit before."
"Woo, he's trying to flirt with Sarah. [inaudible 00:24:26]. Dude, fuck. I have to do my judicial thing tomorrow too. [crosstalk 00:24:40]. G runs and C runs and D runs."
Should I get Sarah back over here? I need help with every single one after this.
"All right, I'm going to get Sarah in a second."
[inaudible 00:25:54].
[inaudible 00:26:02].
Huh? Mm-hmm (affirmative).
What do you mean?
What's wrong with it?
"Not really. You just don't know how. I'm going to ask David, considering he graded my grade, like my work. [crosstalk 00:28:16]."
That's trash.
Well I do need help. [inaudible 00:28:42].
Pay attention in class. It's like she doesn't even speak in English.
She wasn't even speaking English.
No one knows what she was talking about.
Exact right. The entire class is still in here. Anyway.
"No, it's smallest.  "
In second?
First?
"Sarah? Look at that, I got it fucked up. [crosstalk 00:29:54]. Yeah, I have no idea what's 9th, 3rd, 13 and 19 are."
Where are you?
Okay. That's 14.
"Oh, shit, I missed the whole-"
Genius. The next. It's neighboring.
"You're cooking, bro."
Every single one to 19. I did the ones I could.
A bubble sort. I don't even know how to do this.
What is the value?
Yes.
You think so.
"Oh, shit. Textbook helps."
What am I breaking?
Breaking what? What are you talking about?
"No, bro. Wait, I'm not done."
"Yeah, I know. I do know. I have one, so I'm not fucking with it. "
[inaudible 00:35:51].
"Hey, Scott? Scott? Scott? Scott? Do you need 15?"
"[crosstalk 00:36:25]. Yeah, no, no, no."
You're Arabic?
I knew it.
When did I say that?
[inaudible 00:36:49] until he was 17.
You're Lebanese.
"You're lesbian. Whoo, Scott lesbian."
[Sod's 00:37:01] lesbian. Sod [crosstalk 00:37:18]
"How many times she's going to check if this recorder's on, bro. It's like the sixth time today. Oh, I'm about to get it. Sarah?"
I'll let her finish. I'll let her finish.
Because I was at work.
That's not the important part. I was at work.
Because that's not the important part.
That's not important.
"Oh, I work at a pizza place, too."
"On my mother, I work at Papa John's."
Just. You should bring me some pizza. You get free pizza?
You should bring some sometimes.
"Right, that doesn't matter. Hungry is hungry. I've eating 16 goldfish today all day."
"Goldfish, you idiot."
Where's he going?
That shit really fucked me up.
"37. No, 36, 36."
"35. Five, five. "
Five. 
Look at this dude. 
Fire David he's terrible. [crosstalk 00:00:36]. 
She's going to come over here and check it eight times. Can you hear? I'm not really sure. 
Tito did a little check one two thing. 
"No. Sara. [crosstalk 00:01:38]. Yeah, that's lit. Yeah, did you see that? I called Sara's name now she's lost. "
"I called Sara's name and now she's lost. She's looking around. [crosstalk 00:01:53]. Sara. Don't look at. She's looking so lost. [crosstalk 00:02:05]. No, you can go over there first. You can go over there first. [crosstalk 00:02:39]. "
"So, the weekend was crazy and I forgot how to code completely. "
Completely. Don't know what main methods are and classes. 
"Yes, every bit of it including the code. "
I have this much. 
That's the stuff that was given.
How was your weekend? 
It was crazy. 
Yeah. 
Put two thingy majiggy's. 
"The random, yeah. "
I don't know how to do it. 
I don't know. Crazy weekend. I'm telling you. 
Dumb math or something like- 
Oh shit. 
Two. 
[crosstalk 00:05:09]. 
Meh. 
Code. 
"No. No, we can't. Call David. "
Oh my God. 
Yep. 
I could generate. 
You would've cried. [crosstalk 00:07:10]. 
I keep forgetting we have these. I'm going to finger pop you in your [Spanish 00:08:14]. [crosstalk 00:08:16]. Stop it bro. Wake up bro. [crosstalk 00:08:31]. 
I did. 
You said nine to what? 
"Yeah, is it nine to two? "
Did you read it? 
Did Sherman meet us? 
"[crosstalk 00:11:28]. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No that one doesn't work. Those are occupied. [crosstalk 00:11:41]. Did it work? "
She went [crosstalk 00:12:10]. How was your weekend? 
How was your weekend? 
"Nevermind, I don't even know what that is. [crosstalk 00:12:26]. "
Yes bro. 
D and D is lit. [crosstalk 00:12:42]. Sara. [crosstalk 00:12:52]. So we got stuck right after you left. Like all of us. 
No he was not. 
"I did that, and then it gave me a whole bunch of fucking errors like crazy amount of errors. Like keep clicking command Z. Or if you do that. "
I literally copied and pasted that right into there. 
Well I changed the numbers from- 
Why would you put an eight? 
"Wait, what? Hold us why would you have to put an eight though? "
Oh you do the math inside [crosstalk 00:14:52]. 
That's a good question? 
Hey there's no cap. We both know [crosstalk 00:16:47]- 
So then who was working? 
But I thought you did nothing but lead. 
You want to trade? 
You don't get paid nearly enough. You sit there [crosstalk 00:17:35].
That sucks. [crosstalk 00:17:35]. 
Two days from now? We got one in two days? 
"Oh, how much do you get paid? "
"Bro, that's butt cheeks. "
But it's a lot more work. 
Where do you work? [crosstalk 00:18:43]. 
Dude. 
Something then something then put the name and class records [crosstalk 00:19:19]. 
Girl you thought we were done. [crosstalk 00:20:03]- 
You got it? 
"It was like a two way conversation. Like I wasn't a part of it. That's not how it works. [crosstalk 00:20:29]. Sara, smile. You're a bum. [crosstalk 00:20:43]. "
"That ain't it Ethan. [crosstalk 00:29:53]. I know the tune. [crosstalk 00:29:53]. Bro, you can't google that. [crosstalk 00:29:53]. "
Yeah. 
So why don't you? 
And you still don't know how? 
[inaudible 00:30:05]. 
"Show off. [crosstalk 00:30:32]. All right bro, just send it to me and I'll fix it. [crosstalk 00:30:40]. "
Oh my. 
Bass like the big fat thing? [crosstalk 00:32:57]
I would learn how to play the guitar. 
"I remember playing the violin, the guitar and the piano. "
Then I want to learn [crosstalk 00:33:52]. What the hell is that? 
"I want to learn German, French and Spanish. "
You say your parents know German? 
"She said 8:15 but nobody's left. So she's definitely extending it. [crosstalk 00:34:59]. Oh good, 9:00 as of now. [crosstalk 00:35:13]. They're done? "
He just bopped on me. [crosstalk 00:38:41]. Damn.
Is your phone charging? 
Bruh. I need it connected. [crosstalk 00:40:11]. I'm waiting for you to give me these answers. [crosstalk 00:40:17]. I'm about figure it out when he comes over here. [crosstalk 00:40:28]. But all of them are over there. 
Did you get it? 
Think she'd be mad if I just- 
What you doing bro? [crosstalk 00:45:50]. 
You finished? What the hell you waiting for? What are you waiting for? 
Hey did you finish? [crosstalk 00:47:35]
There's new colors? That justifies. 
"All right, I'm doing it bro. "
What the fuck was he talking about? Chris? 
What the fuck are you talking about? 
It's just the same shit. They're never changing the colors. It's [crosstalk 00:51:23] and rose gold. [crosstalk 00:51:26]. Colored air pods. These fake ass shits. [crosstalk 00:51:37]. 
They say something about his leak [crosstalk 00:52:07]. It was leak. 20? 
Wait. Eight games a night? [crosstalk 00:52:31]. How many games came up on the night? 
"How? [crosstalk 00:53:05]. I think so. Hey, we're going to leave. [crosstalk 00:53:08]-"










[inaudible 00:00:00]. Hey.
Five.
"Nine, 10, 11, 12."
"Yo, David? Stay on that side of the classroom today, please."
[crosstalk 00:00:24] try again.
Is that hard?
"Like, hard hard?"
Only when I need to.
[crosstalk 00:01:16].
"Yeah, pull up assignment four. I want to see it."
(humming)
"You have to ... Oh, just the one where you have to create a game, right?"
She has selective hearing. I've noticed that.
"No, I was just reading the board."
[inaudible 00:03:57].
"Hey! Easy, dog."
[crosstalk 00:04:35].
Did you use special reasoning?
Is that seven?
It's not ...
"Didn't I tell you to stay over there, bro? [crosstalk 00:05:06] die. Hold your breath while he's here, guys. David, what do you have? Yo?"
What do you have?
What do you have?
He has consumption.
Nope. 
Yeah. 
"Yep, this is going to work."
"Oh, shit."
Doesn't work.
"(singing) Damn. Random, like inside the computer."
"Yo, Brandon looking hella hard, bruh. You see him [crosstalk 00:08:59]? His head was like [crosstalk 00:09:12]."
Huh?
"No, I don't have any fucking answers [crosstalk 00:09:47]."
"No, I'm not copying. I'm about to start copying you."
Copy and paste what? It's not on there.
Huh?
[crosstalk 00:10:06] creating these shits lately.
[crosstalk 00:10:12].
"Yo, Chris. It's not recording, bruh."
"Yo, if you mess up [crosstalk 00:10:35]."
"You can't mess up [Najin's 00:10:38] research, bruh. She'll be mad."
Najin gon be sick as hell if you messed up her research.
[crosstalk 00:11:01] sucks.
"Damn it, [crosstalk 00:11:09], you messed up her research."
[crosstalk 00:11:17] making jokes about this shit. 
[crosstalk 00:11:31] find something new everywhere.
[crosstalk 00:11:38]. 
[crosstalk 00:11:42]. I hope you know it's set to my voice.
"Yeah, but it's set to your damn voice."
"[crosstalk 00:11:51]. Hey, Siri."
"Hey, Siri? What'd I tell you, bruh?"
"Hey, Siri?"
"Now, you try it."
"See, bruh?"
What the hell? [crosstalk 00:12:26] going to look like that.
[crosstalk 00:12:37] what?
"Does it have any other ... Oh, [crosstalk 00:12:43] strange."
"Oh, damn. [crosstalk 00:12:47] an iPhone. Maybe I should've waited [crosstalk 00:12:49] to buy."
Did I scare you?
I just wanted to scare you.
"She's Australian. [crosstalk 00:13:33] they're funny. Listen, say something."
"She has [crosstalk 00:13:37], bruh."
"[crosstalk 00:13:52] shit up. Yo, I'm bout to just get Sarah over here, bruh. She's not going to [crosstalk 00:13:56]. Yo, Angie, did you just vop on your partner?"
Did you just vop on your partner? Where's your partner?
"He's done two minutes into the class, bruh."
"Naw, he just [crosstalk 00:14:17], bruh."
"Naw, they left. I know the other guy [crosstalk 00:14:22] his first one done. He goddamn [crosstalk 00:14:25]."
How do you think they be getting it done so fucking fast?
"Morgan, how are you still not done, bruh? Skylar said you've been working for, like, eight years."
What are you setting it to?
"He's worried about Najin's research, bruh. Let him be."
Yo. What'd you set it to?
Is that what it's supposed to be?
What the hell happened?
What are [crosstalk 00:15:35]?
"Yo. I stole, like, four cups of water from Starbucks, because Papa John's doesn't have any water."
Papa John's doesn't give you water.
[crosstalk 00:16:09] smokes crack.
"David doesn't come to class, bruh."
My dog.
What?
[crosstalk 00:16:25] the extra credit.
[crosstalk 00:16:30].
[crosstalk 00:16:34]. That's my dog. Me and my dog. Who is this?
[crosstalk 00:16:47].
"Well, let's just skip the code [crosstalk 00:17:00]."
I'm stick my thumb in your [crosstalk 00:17:10].
[crosstalk 00:17:15]. You never heard the ...
[inaudible 00:17:19] March Madness.
March Madness.
"Not fucking actual March Madness, you crack head."
What's this say?
What that shit mean?
You asshole.

What the hell?
Google crazy as shit.
"[crosstalk 00:21:58], bruh."
"You ain't send it to me, you phony."
"Hey, Siri?"
"Or, you can do it that way, too."

What's this nigga wearing? Looks like he was about to go dirt biking. Vroom vroom.
I sound like a dirt bike. I don't know how to ride them.
Where's she at? 
[crosstalk 00:25:06].
"[crosstalk 00:25:11]. That's my real name, Sarida."
[crosstalk 00:25:19] Asian or something.
Who are you texting?
I don't play nothing.
(singing)
"Fuck. You know I'm taking calc 2 right now, [crosstalk 00:26:43] next semester? I'ma ahead in math. (singing) ... What?"
The placement test. [crosstalk 00:26:59].

"Like, you just walk in?"
Should I take it for you? I'll put you in major [crosstalk 00:27:10].
"Yo. You, like, nigga, so I'll put you in [crosstalk 00:27:20]."

Yeah. 
"Yeah, [crosstalk 00:28:49]."
"Yes, that's your phone. What the fuck is that ringtone?"
Can you send me a [crosstalk 00:30:12]?

"I should be, but I'm not."
"All right, now do you have it?"
"Yo, now do you have it?"
What the fuck are you doing?
It's due today.
It's due today.
"You clean though, right?"
"Oh, my God. Thank you."
Aight. I was Googling-
Arabic people.
"Yeah. I saw y'all be bombing shits, and give food to another [crosstalk 00:31:15]."
We don't cook curry. [crosstalk 00:31:20] eat that shit. 
"My mama cooks it for me. I go home, and I eat it, bruh."
I could make some.
One problem though.
"Washing clothes, we go to laundry."
I'm pretty sure that [crosstalk 00:31:43] should be [crosstalk 00:31:44].
How in the world you getting to campus?
"Like, a mile and a half."
You can't walk there.
"There's bus stops, the rich bus stops."
Yeah. Talk to him and then let me know. I don't want you to have to struggle-
What the hell are y'all doing?
What are y'all playing?
[crosstalk 00:33:43] you don't ever see a person wave?
"I don't know how that happened, bruh."
"Bro, quit [crosstalk 00:34:20]."
[crosstalk 00:34:20].
"Six is [crosstalk 00:34:20], bro."
I saw that coming. It's Toronto.
It's Toronto. It's their city's thing.
[crosstalk 00:34:37].
You got to respect them.
"All right, but it's going to be Toronto in five, though."
"Yo, [crosstalk 00:35:11] hurry the hell up, bruh."
[crosstalk 00:35:14] I'm trying to go.

"Angie, you're playing hard as shit over there."
Where is the rest of your family at?
Where's the rest of your family?
"No, bruh. Like, you're here."
You're here on your own?
"Like, here in Charlotte?"
"I was bout to say, boy, what?"

How much of that did she do?
[crosstalk 00:37:32] her?

[crosstalk 00:37:55] then?
What's wrong with it?
"Bro, are you guys really going hard [crosstalk 00:38:18]?"
She gave it to [crosstalk 00:40:22].
"This nigga stupid, man!"
"Ugh. Oh, my fucking God, dude. What's that fancy ... Wait, wait, wait, it's not fancy. It's from China. It's, like, $10 [inaudible 00:41:02] from Amazon. David, who is grading my work?"
"[crosstalk 00:41:13] grades, bruh. He's sitting right there."
Who the hell's grading our work?
Who the hell's grading our work?
"Bruh, how am I getting grade thingies right now. You're sitting over here."
