"Yeah, just [crosstalk 00:00:00].",
Mm-hmm (affirmative). [crosstalk 00:00:06].,
"Dude, I had no idea what I'm doing. This is great. ",
I think I know what it's talking about. [crosstalk 00:00:33]. It's just super inefficient. It's to get the point across. [crosstalk 00:00:36].,
Enter with a rectangle. [crosstalk 00:00:55].,
"Int(x) [crosstalk 00:01:03] input dot next, int ... [crosstalk 00:01:06]. Okay, here ...",
"Wait, there. [crosstalk 00:01:30].",
Rectangle. [crosstalk 00:02:11].,
"Anthony, quick question. [crosstalk 00:03:09]. I feel that. Quick question. If this is, say the method for rectangle, for instance, how do I call this value up here? [crosstalk 00:03:40]. Because this does the calculations and it calls the value. [crosstalk 00:03:40].",
"Oh, so I need to make this [crosstalk 00:03:45]-",
It should just be public static ... [crosstalk 00:03:58].,
"Hold on. Should I have a ... that, or something along those lines?",
I just want to figure out how to get ... I'm very new to methods. I just wanted to know how to get that there. How that worked.,
Okay.,
"Yes. For this case it will be int. [crosstalk 00:04:53]. Assuming I'm not taking double. Assuming I don't take doubles, which is for the sake of conversation.",
Yeah.,
Should I just delete the into here because it's not necessary?,
Really? [crosstalk 00:05:27]. I thought the method-,
"To get dimensions of each shape [crosstalk 00:05:37]. This bit, instead of having a switch here, instead of having this in this portion of the switch-",
... those should be [crosstalk 00:05:48]-,
"This is here, so we don't need the int here. Actually, yeah, we don't nee the ints, because they're up here. [crosstalk 00:06:01]. Do I need to make a new scanner?",
Should I make a new scanner then for this? Do I need to have ...,
"Okay. We have this, and now how do I get this method to return of value? For this, I basically want this to return whatever value I get here, so how do I ... Is there a return command or do I just put the name?",
Would I just do like return area?,
I would do area here?,
Do I need to do like rectangle and then parentheses over there or ... It has to know ... Right now it doesn't know which method I'm talking about.,
I don't know how to do that. Do you just type call?,
"Did I spell it wrong, maybe? [crosstalk 00:07:38].",
I don't think I am.,
Should I delete the parameter?,
"Okay. Now this needs [inaudible 00:08:22]. Now I need to [crosstalk 00:08:22]. In here, and in there.",
"Nope, same kind of ...",
"I think we have to call this, but I don't want to [crosstalk 00:08:41].",
"Oh, that's how you do it?",
"Then, if I do three and three ... oh, okay. Okay.",
Okay. I gotcha. That makes a lot more sense to me. Okay.,
Gotcha.,
"All right. That makes sense. Okay, thank you. I understand, Anthony. [crosstalk 00:09:32]. It's still inefficient. [crosstalk 00:09:38]. Square ... [crosstalk 00:09:47].",
"Curiosity, if I delete this will that cause problems? [crosstalk 00:10:04]. Do you understand how to do this? ",
"This is basically how it works, methods are gonna kind of act as the stuff that's in your case.",
"Basically, what you do. Basically a word with two parentheses after it is a method.",
"All right, basically what you do is ... I have a switch here, and it's basically, if it's rectangle it displays that, and then when it gets to this rectangle it'll go to this method. When it gets to this method ...",
"Yeah, it's gonna read method, and then it's gonna run this portion of the code.",
"Then, this is basically, you're gonna have to re-declare everything that I have, so [crosstalk 00:11:06].",
"I have a new scanner here. I basically asked them the width. I declare my X, I put in my Y. I get the area. Then, you have to have something that the method's gonna return, basically like, what's the final value of this method? I did return area. When it goes back up here it runs this and it's finally gonna return area, which is gonna give me that. [crosstalk 00:11:29].",
"It's basically all of this up to here, it's cut and paste from the case state. You just moved it over.",
"They want us to do it like this for the sake of learning it. [crosstalk 00:11:48] stuff like, player movement and things like that, it's gonna get pretty [inaudible 00:11:53] pretty fast. The way methods work is it's kind of like, it doesn't have to read ... as she described it's like a calculator. It only calls on different calculators when it needs them, other than having all of them available at once.",
"For this case we use the switch to do the name. This next one would be like, try square. [crosstalk 00:12:25]. Stuff like that.",
You can. Yeah. When you program there's a billion different ways to do things. There's no difference between them. I just did it because it looks prettier. [crosstalk 00:12:41]. I have nothing else to say on that. [crosstalk 00:12:46].,
"Yeah. This is in the main, and then this ends, the main ends. Then I give a new method. [crosstalk 00:13:10]. I go to here, and I go to square, and then I do int(x) [crosstalk 00:13:38]. I'm basically just gonna copy this, because [crosstalk 00:13:40] code. [crosstalk 00:13:46].",
"While I do square ... Oh, hold on, that should be different. That should just be ... [crosstalk 00:13:52].",
If I had the [metamethod 00:15:03] for triangle ... [crosstalk 00:15:05].,
"All right, I'm getting this. I'm getting this. Do you need any more explanations?",
"No, you're good. You're fine. It's doing that because you haven't returned anything yet. Currently that has no value.",
You have to write the rest of your code.,
"It's basically like, watch, if I have triangle and I delete this, [crosstalk 00:17:05] ...",
Your method has to return something.,
"Otherwise, it has no point in running. [crosstalk 00:17:13]. Okay, [crosstalk 00:18:07].",
"As far as I know. There's probably a way to do it around it, but I don't know it. [crosstalk 00:18:30].",
"The reason why you add methods is so ... look at this, this [crosstalk 00:19:23] the ... [crosstalk 00:19:25]. This is Pokemon. Check this out. [crosstalk 00:19:35]. This was my Pokemon. This is the Pokemon [yen 00:19:43] that I programmed. One of the things I found really annoying was how cluttered it got. I had this switch statement here, I was like, oh that's shit. Then ... Sorry. [crosstalk 00:19:56]. Got to remember that.",
"Basically, see how cluttered, how it keeps going over, and over, and over and then you have all of this here, and it gets mixed in, and it keeps going over? Basically what you're doing is, you're putting those calculations off to the side, and it would basically just look like this-",
"... which is far easier to understand. [crosstalk 00:20:20]. You use it mainly to just get rid of the clutter and put it somewhere else. It's like, imagine instead of having all [crosstalk 00:20:26] your stuff scattered all around your room, you put it in a box, and then you only grab the box when you need it.",
"Yeah, and then [crosstalk 00:20:36] it goes to this, rather than the Pokemon [crosstalk 00:20:38] that we did, which is basically it ran a 10 statement [crosstalk 00:20:43] thing here.",
I could probably program this again. Actual code that does stuff will probably only be like twice as long as this case statement.,
"I would move everything to the bottom, and then whenever I needed to edit it I'd edit it. I'd basically just go to these statements and I'd just be like, method for rectangle. [crosstalk 00:21:10]. I'd have another be like, method for choosing with Pokemon to install.",
"Man, I thought methods were totally useless, but now I kind of want to redo the other project I did. [crosstalk 00:21:28].",
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:21:31]. If you have a really complex program it's gonna be incredibly disorganized.,
"Now if I do circle, and I do like four, yeah ... [crosstalk 00:21:54]. Does that kind of help explain why you do them?",
"Yeah. As far as I know. [crosstalk 00:22:08]. When you get to more advanced stuff and it's like, say you're doing player movement, [crosstalk 00:22:14] you might have hundreds of lines of code for just player movement. You might have another hundreds of lines of code for just gravity on player.",
"When you would do your code, and you'd be like making a level or something, all you'd have to do is call player movement, like a one word statement, instead of having 400 things. If you want to do the calculation more than once, you can just call it twice rather than having to write the whole thing twice.",
I'm liking it. [crosstalk 00:22:56].,
"Inquire [crosstalk 00:23:24] scanner. [crosstalk 00:23:28]. Dude, that was honestly so eye opening. [crosstalk 00:23:40]. Come on. [crosstalk 00:23:44].",
Yes. [crosstalk 00:24:47].,
"I didn't do a square today. [crosstalk 00:25:32]. The second one is a case where you'd absolutely not use a method, but they want us to use a method, so I'm using a method. [crosstalk 00:26:02].",
There's so ... [crosstalk 00:26:02]. There's two ... [crosstalk 00:26:13]. Do we have a problem? [crosstalk 00:26:13].,
Oh okay. [crosstalk 00:27:53].,
Public static. [crosstalk 00:28:05]. I have a better way of doing this.,
"Super quick question. So, problem 2 was just random method that calculates heads or tails. This works, but is this the way that we were supposed to do it? 'Cause it basically just does the calculation here, and then if it's equal to zero ... if the method's equal to zero, it basically prints that, and if it's not, it prints this.",
"Yeah, 'cause is either gonna return zero or one. And basically, if it's zero, it's even. And if it's one, it's odd.",
"Well, that's why I was asking. Is this the way you're supposed ... is it an acceptable way of doing this?",
"Oh, got it. I thought that it always had to go back to the [inaudible 00:31:29].",
Cool.,
"Oh ... I'm about to go, so ...",
Yes.,
"Yeah. I think he's still working, though.",
We've got two minutes.,
"Okay, so this is the code for activity 1.",
This is the code for activity 2.,
"Oh, do you have domain of your method? So, where's your other method? Go to one of your methods for like rectangles. Alright, you've got rectangles. So, go back up. Rectangle ... yeah, it's working. What's the problem?",
"That is because ... hold up. [inaudible 00:33:14] and you have all the crap in here. Is this inside or outside your interval? Okay, it's inside. Square ... your returning area.",
"You might have to use ""dot equals"" in an ""if"" statement. Oh, I've been done. I've just been helping him out. Oh, I forgot to do the exit form. Crap. To do what? The exit form?",
"Oh my God, I have to put my name? They know I can't spell. That's the interesting [crosstalk 00:34:33]. This is my official response.",
What'd you learn about today? What'd you not understand?,
"Oh my God, there's a page two. No. How do you feel about our teamwork today? Be honest.",
"Solid? ""Solid"" it is. Oh wow. That's almost two minutes I'll never get back.",
"Yeah, I was about to say ... because ""if"" statements ...",
"For case statements, you can just take it. But for ""if,"" I'm pretty sure you need a ""dot equals."" Just because Java. And if this was any other language, it would just work. If anything, it would just correct it. That's one of the better parts about C Sharp. C Sharp's like, ""You made an error? I just fixed it for you.""",
Because you're going to college here. How do I stop this?,
Hold on.,
"March 19th. 7. 8. [inaudible 00:36:58] where you wanna put that. Dude, mine's broken.",
"No, it doesn't clip. It pulls back ...",
"I am not doing that. Tell you what, I'll put it through a button hole.",
"I'm gonna try something that's probably not going to work, but we'll see what happens.",
Ah shit. Just gotta make this one [inaudible 00:43:09] once.,
What?,
It's always a trick question. When has it ever not been a trick question?,
This is a cruel class.,
Do you ever want to just take the zero and just go home?,
It's literally current mindset today.,
"It's just like ... dude, it just isn't worth it. When the class average gets 20% of the poll everywhere right, like-",
I could've sworn it was a parameter. I might go with local variable. But I really don't think that's ... It's all I know.,
How many methods are used in this program?,
"Yeah, can this class get over 20%?",
Raise your hand if you got a 0 today.,
God. No idea what I'm doing here.,
[inaudible 00:57:57].,
"Man, I am not looking hot for this exam coming up.",
"I got mine working, but with a little help from online.",
The amount of freaking description I had to do for Assignment Two. It's like 100 lines of typing.,
Cause that was the pseudocode for it.,
"I hate when you see the solutions sometimes and it's just so few lines of code and so simple, and it's like why does that work? You read and you understand why it works, but it's like why is it that simple?",
"My first iteration of this was, I had, like, six different variables because I didn't know what to do.",
"Dude, honestly, for this exam, I'm gonna copy and paste this program into my one page of notes. Cause it's just like, I'm not gonna remember how to do it.",
This is crazy.,
"Yeah, [inaudible 01:28:47]",
"Yeah, I'll catch you later, dude.",
[Vamos 01:28:58],
"Yeah, I'll email this to you so you can take a look at it. ",
We got to- Do we have to press something on there.,
"Alright, see ya.",
I remember the steps [inaudible 01:34:09]. I remember you said [inaudible 01:34:14] for part two.,
And we're not allowed to use [inaudible 01:34:18]?,
You want to use the weight?,
Eight.,
Here. This is ... I promise you these are correct here.,
"This is just kind of like, shows the type of developers these people are. I only get a [inaudible 01:38:15]. Not many.",
Borderlands [inaudible 01:39:19].,
This game or another.,
"[Seth 01:39:54], it's its own game. Okay, that part I don't agree with, but moving on.",
It's right here.,
"So do I. Yeah, it's [inaudible 01:40:24] piece of work. Hard to [inaudible 01:40:26]. So, they take a very [inaudible 01:40:31] ...",
To their [inaudible 01:40:33].,
"That's like, their spoof trailer, because that's like, a song that's the like ... That's a famous kind of song like, in the jungle, the mighty jungle.",
So they just ... They bought the rights for that [inaudible 01:40:54] trailer.,
Yeah.,
Okay.,
"Yeah, 'cause we were wondering about that.",
"It's ... one, two ...",
"So I think the first step for declaring [inaudible 01:42:23], I'm pretty sure is just this.",
"'Cause it's like, you declared a range here, which is a number, and you just input the range there. And then ...",
I gotta look for the [inaudible 01:42:52].,
"I've got it here. So ... Hold on. We've got to do ... index. Zero. Four. I, equals the one. I is [inaudible 01:43:09]. Not my list.",
Greater than ...,
Hold on. This is ...,
Wait. Double max [inaudible 01:43:57].,
"I don't know if this is right, but that's what they use.",
That's what they use for finding the max.,
"[inaudible 01:44:45]. When I first played this game, I had to have been like, 13, man.",
Yeah.,
"I'm about to turn ... I'm 19, but I'm about to turn 20, and it came out seven years ago. That's a long ass time.",
Oh.,
We do have the mic on. Eight.,
"Wait, I'm just going to copy this. This is literally just saying how to display an array.",
"Damn, dude, we have lab tomorrow. I actually have to wake up early.",
Wouldn't you know.,
"Of course. [inaudible 01:46:31] the values yet. [inaudible 01:46:33] so I was like, yeah, print out your array, and it's like, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.",
[inaudible 01:46:46],
"Oh, here we go.",
There we go.,
I was [inaudible 01:48:04] random.,
"Hold on, that's a random ... What [inaudible 01:48:10] again.",
"Oh yeah, the ... 'cause you gotta cast the ...",
"Yep, yep, yep. Yep, yep. Yep, yep. Yep. Yep. That didn't work.",
"Oh yeah, 'cause you gotta do ... hold on. You gotta do this.",
You gotta do ... plus ... 'cause it's gonna generate a number between zero and .99.,
You also divide by 10.,
"Yeah, it should have worked.",
Why doesn't that work?,
I don't understand. I'm gonna fight. I'm gonna just come up and [inaudible 01:51:54].,
Just a quick question. What part of this am I doing wrong? 'Cause this is currently not entering any values to the array.,
"'Cause it's basically like, oh, run it? Or they're like, 10.",
And it's all zero.,
"Yeah, I got you.",
So don't need to ...,
Thank you. I appreciate it.,
I [inaudible 01:53:31] once again. For the second time today.,
"Yeah. What you had to do is, you had to separate in [inaudible 01:54:10].",
Next value in array by showing [inaudible 01:54:34]. They're showing its value and index of that value.,
I just want to ...,
"Wow, that works. Let me try it again.",
"Wow. I didn't expect that to work, but it did.",
"You can copy them. This is just a model they use to do it. Is they do this. Basically, if the array is great than ... So, it's basically like that entry is greater than the maximum entry. Than the max now equals that entry. And the index is equal to whatever we're on.",
"So it's basically ...So this is, so the max is currently three. And this is four. Four is greater than three, so it's gonna set max equal to this, which is four.",
"And then they're gonna set the index equal to ""i"". So say this is the eleventh term, the index is now eleven. And then it runs again, and it's like ... So this is seven. Now it's gonna do ... The max is now equal to seven and the index is equal to ... seven. Instead it's like ...",
"Yeah, and so this is three, then it will just increment ""i"" and then go again.",
'Cause it's not.,
"I'm gonna guess how to do this one, but I think I'm gonna get it right.",
Let me test this.,
1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 9 x 7 x 6 + 6 ... 30 + 30 + 4 + 3 + 5 divided by 15 is 3.86.,
So it is working.,
"Find the elements that have higher values than the average value and copy them into a new array named ""High Values."" All right, so that's just another formula.",
This is hard.,
Yeah.,
"Oh, it crashed.",
Nope.,
Yeah. I'm gonna ask for guidance.,
"So I ... In theory, I thought this would work. So, I basically ... Is it possible to generate an array without a fix lane?",
"Okay. So I just did zero, for instance. And then basically what this loop does is it's gonna iterate through the original array.",
"And it's basically ... If it's greater than the average, I add this value, which is currently at zero, equal that value, and then ""x"" increases-",
"Does that like ... Is this illegal? Like it ... Okay. Let's try this, because it's still loading.",
"So how do I ... 'Cause plus equals didn't work there either. Is ... How do you add terms to an array, and not ...",
'Cause all I'm trying to do here is basically just be like-,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
"Yeah this is ... This is the first array, so this is the one that the person sets. And it's basically saying if it's greater than it's own average down here, I was gonna have this second array, which is a new one. Currently there's nothing in it. Basically, this entry which is currently at zero-",
"Would be equal to the value of that index, of that array's index, and then it increases to the next index, so that when this runs again it says greater-",
Then [inaudible 02:07:20] the array [crosstalk 02:07:21].,
"No, they're gonna be different lengths.",
"Okay, so how do I just like ... What would keep tacking ... 'Cause all I'm trying to do is keep tacking on terms to array two. You put-",
"'Cause it's basically ... like the assignment is you take all the ... You take all of the values that are higher than the average in one array, and you stick 'em in another array.",
"It's basically, you find all the events that have higher value than the average and you copy them into a new one.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
Okay.,
"Okay, so then this segment will ... 'Cause you get what I'm trying to do, right?",
"Feeble at best. So you're saying that I should do for ... I'm just like, I'm worrying here. I will [inaudible 02:09:04].",
Yeah.,
"Hold on. [inaudible 02:09:46] And then in this one, we'll do ...",
"Yeah, this should just work.",
Yes.,
[inaudible 02:10:08]. 'Cause I was like-,
"I'm like, ""I know this logic is good.""",
"I'm kind of like, ""There's obviously some questions I don't know.""",
"Yeah, that makes sense. I understand they have boundaries, I just didn't know how to get around those boundaries.",
Uh-huh (affirmative).,
"Okay. [inaudible 02:10:49]. 'Cause it's like I took C# in high school, one and two oh so long ago, and I don't remember a lot of the nuances.",
Yes. That command I remember.,
There you go.,
That's where [inaudible 02:11:13].,
Huh. All right. This should work.,
"All right, I'm on the last step.",
"Okay, that works. Oh! Are you currently stuck on any in particular set? ",
"Average? Like displaying the average, or making a new array with the average?",
"Okay, so he actually showed something really smart. 'Cause my logic was right, I just was missing pieces.",
"Then what you do is you make a counter ... and basically what you have is you do another loop. And it basically gets greater than the average above the counter line. 'Cause arrays have to be a fixed length, you can't add to them and subtract from them. If you say they're this length, they are that length. So what you do is you make a counter. The counter goes up at ... So this loop calculate the array. So this one here. This loop, every time the index is gonna be higher than the average, the counter's gonna go up. Then all you have to do is just make your new array the length of that counter.",
"And then what you have here is, this loop's basically ... If the array is greater than the average, the array two's index of, currently is zero, is gonna equal whatever that array's index is. And then-",
Yeah. So this is like ... Let's separate this into-,
"Yeah, you are. 'Cause D, it's telling you to move the values into a new array.",
"Oh, the average? What I did was, I basically summed all the terms",
"And then divided by the length. That's what I did. So I summed all the terms inside the loop, and then outside the loop I divided by the length.",
Just wanna make sure this works real quick.,
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). I'm currently organizing it so it isn't ugly. Like what I'm doing, what I find really helpful, is I'm having A coat B coat C coat D. That way it's just ...",
"It's just a little easier, yeah. So like if I have a problem, I can just go there.",
F: Creating another array the same type and size of the source array. All right. And ...,
"Oh, shit dude. All right, I'll email you this.",
"This is like, it's a little weird.",
Huh?,
"Yeah, sure. Feel free.",
Oh.,
Were they similar?,
,
Eight.,
"So, I already talked to [Nazerine 00:00:13] about this.",
"It's basically, this low value to begin with should be four, not three, but no matter that, we pick three, because the other ones are not choice. This one's ready to go equals two, yada, yada, yada. ",
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you get down here is the problem, because those are like, obviously it's a typo. Not the end of the world. This one's right, but when you get here, RQ we're looking for is six, which is still behind 12, because right now our unit is 12. So, six is behind it. So, normally you'd pick is less than mid, and that says now we check the upper half, which you wouldn't do. You'd check the lower half. And then if you were to pick anything else there's no option to continue off of it. So, these two things are both wrong because I imagine the array was different than when they wrote the question.",
"Well, I found this out afterwards. The rest of it is kind of manageable.",
"They're pretty much completely wrong, because it's like basically you get a unit as 12, and we're looking for six. So, our key is less than 12, and this says now check the other remaining half and then ... Which is wrong. It should be the lower remaining half. And then you can't even add another option to back that up.",
I doubt any of this was.,
Can we just like-,
"Yeah, that's what I said. Can we just eradicate this step.",
"You wouldn't have finished because you'd have to go through another duration of finding [inaudible 00:01:59]. Because right now you have them in as 12 and that's still greater than the key so it'd want another time. And so, the new mid, which would end up being six, [crosstalk 00:02:10]. ",
"So, it's like both seven and eight don't work.",
"This is basically like I just copied this over. This mystery method is this, which I copied from an earlier question which was provided earlier. What I imagine is when this question was written, you had a different array asking for different things.",
"Oh, see, well-",
"This is mystery method too. This is the binary one, this is the linear one. I did this so that I could keep it one [crosstalk 00:02:56].",
"Yeah, well, that's actually it. I renamed it.",
"But it's basically just redundant. I think when this question was written it had a different array associated with it. I mean, if we could just not count these questions, I mean, it's kind of problem solved.",
Key is six.,
This is question 10.,
"yeah, they're already when they're like what to pick afterwards.",
Thank you.,
"Yes, this is for question 10. Thank you. They're going to invalidate question 10.",
Yeah. They're going to double check one more time but I'm pretty sure they had a different array when they wrote it.,
"So, anyway, it's going to be stranded which surface is more efficient for finding [inaudible 00:04:53] binary. Question 12.",
Are you guys working through question 10?,
Skip that for now because I'm pretty sure it's wrong. There's supposed to be a different regulate so she's checking over it right now.,
Because I'm pretty sure there's an error. ,
Page 884. Just casually go there. It's the one on it.,
I think just. This source just got so many problems with it. This is dumb.,
23 point ... Almost starting. Here we are. Of course. It's definitely on page-,
884. Of course it is. Because why wouldn't it not be on that page.,
"Oh, bubble [inaudible 00:08:23]. Yeah, this is like the worst type of stern.",
Yeah.,
It's basically like what this is doing is two is less than nine so it ignores it. Five plus the nine so ignores it. Four is less than nine so it ignores it. Eight is less than nine so it ignores it. It basically just keeps swapping it to just make sure that ... It's pretty dumb because it has to go through like a billion iterations in order to work.,
"But it's a way of sorting where ... It's just worse, quite frankly, because when you [crosstalk 00:09:19].",
"Well, it's probably some another guy trying to get a fricking PhD. But it's basically like linear serving you only have to pass through it once. Actually never mind. The way this is ... This is actually different. I didn't think about it. This is a sorting method, not a searching method.",
"So, this is how it sorts numbers.",
There's better options. We'll leave it at that. Because this has to go through dozens of iterations sometimes.,
"I should have copied this just straight from there. Some ecstatic word mystery method in for open, open, open. Dude, they even screwed up the starting method. Good on them. What a bunch of capable individuals. Open, open. One, one, two, three, two, one. Yep. Exactly as I said. Dude, they screwed up twice.",
They messed up brackets.,
Huh?,
It works?,
"Can you check over my logic then, because I honestly don't see where they ... That just means I don't understand something.",
"So, you get this is length minus one so seven plus eight is zero. Divided by two is 3.5 which goes to three. So, zero, one, two, three. So, mid is 33. Six is smaller so go on to the next thing. Our new low variable is equal to the mid plus one, which is three plus one which is four. So, mid is now equal to four, even though we have to take-",
"Oh, I got you. I got you. Okay. My new high variable. I missed that one. Code, man. I missed it.",
"Yeah, that one right there. My variable is two. That makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. So, now it's two divided by two which is one. Mid now equals six and so our mid is equal a key. Switch our mid which is once. All right. Yep. That makes sense. That makes sense. Man, I'm dumb sometimes.",
"This is a bubble. This is a bubble story, right? ",
"15. Oh, we're doing this by hand? All right. That's [inaudible 00:14:02]. Okay. Oh. We'll swap those.",
"You're good. How do you get the two over there? I thought that wasn't possible. I thought that with first iteration it wasn't possible. All right. So, five and three swap. So, five and three swaps to get three, five and you get two, five. I need a piece of paper for this.",
"All right. So, you have ... I still don't think this is right. Five, three, two eighths, nine, six.",
"So, five and three swaps. This is three five.",
"Five swaps. So, three is less than five.",
"I have no idea what these guys are smoking, man.",
"One two three. Well, I'm missing a bracket. If you don't mind me asking, so this is missing a bracket and I don't know where to put it. Like it has three opening brackets and two closing brackets.",
"Well, if it's like a loop, you don't want to be looping.",
Okay.,
Okay.,
Okay. I just wanted to check before I started the calculation.,
"Oh. I don't even know what I started to screw up there. Oh, because it skipped down. Three five. Oh, that's too funny. All right. Five three two eight. This will go to three five two two five eight eight eight. Three two five eight. Why not? Shh.",
"All right. So, three five, three five and 12 plus three and five. I don't even know one and one.",
"Five and three go to four and five. And to five and three, you have three five two eighths. You have to swap three to five eight. And you go three ... So, it's you just got swapped. So, it's three two. ",
"I'm not going to finish, man.",
There's no way I'm finishing this one.,
"Oh, let's do nine. Nine [inaudible 00:24:34] and I do add nine. Oh. I still don't know what kind of shape this is going to do.",
"Well, what kind of method is this supposed to be for [inaudible 00:25:41]? It could be a selection sort, as well.",
Two that I don't know what type of surface is.,
"I'm piggybacking off of them. Watch me. Selections. Wait, am I not doing it. I'm pretty sure we did a selections for it.",
"Two and five swap. Oh, yeah, I get this. I get this. I get this. What's value three five? What's the next list value? Five. Five and nine so stay six point eight two three five six eight. Five six seven nine eight. Eight five six seven nine eight. Two three five six seven eight nine three five six seven.",
"All right. So, for this one, the way it works, it picks the lowest number.",
"And swaps it. So, it goes to the first index and swaps it with the lowest number in the eighth. Then next lowest number. So, initially it's five. So, the first index is five. It then swaps it with the lowest number in the array. Which is two. So, two and five swap places.",
"Then you go to the next one. Then goes the second one. It takes three. It then compares it to the second lowest number in the array. Three is the second lowest number so it stays the same. You go to the next one. It goes to the third index where it takes the third lowest number. In this case is five. That ends up being the same so it stays the same. You go to the next one, however-",

Pretty much.,
I'll figure out what that does later. Put this ... Is it pulling on yours? Stick that end in your pocket.,
We can have this work. See what happens?,

I have no idea what I'm doing.,
I just copied it from the book and changed their metrics value to mid array. It was all I did.,
Three plus three plus two is eight. Divided by two is four. Why'd it add up in only one column though?,
Do you see anything wrong with this? Like I'm running it. There's no errors or anything. Because there's no values in it. It's got nothing to.,
"There's no ... Well, then you haven't put any values in it yet. ",
It started to working.,

So, I woke up at like ... Suppose you're be up normal at 10:00. And [crosstalk 00:14:08] it was like [crosstalk 00:14:08].",
I mean they're soft but that would be it.,
We're doing chapter eight and I realized that [crosstalk 00:14:31] and I got [crosstalk 00:14:31] and I realized for a [crosstalk 00:14:31].,
There's also a big overlap with a [crosstalk 00:15:08].,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
I just can't process how this should be done. Actually let's just do this. I just realized I haven't.,
Is there really [inaudible 00:18:20]? What else do they want?,
to find an export. [crosstalk 00:19:07].,
All right. I've got one of them working. I have no idea how to make this work as a function though.,
So [crosstalk 00:19:50].,
Does track hatch exist in Java? Does track hatch exist in Java?,
"I'm just really struggling on how to make a function. Like this calculates for only the first column. Which you average only the first column. I'm struggling to make [inaudible 00:21:09] where it's going to do it for every column, depending on how many columns there are. Because like-",
"Because you need ... Because it's like if you have three columns, you need to have three averages. Like you could also have five columns, in which case you need five averages.",
And I don't know how to make it so it's like-,
Like how many. Like make more averages if I need to. Like because what I-,
Yeah.,
The width.,
And then-,
This one's hard.,
It's basically like you're going to generate-,
"You're going to generate a random number of columns and rows. You're going to fill them with random values. And then you need to display the average of each of the columns, of each column separately. So, it's like-",
"So, when you run it is like ... So, you have like this.",
I'm just struggling on how you would input the values.,
Because you would do ... Come on.,
"Let's try this. So, in it-",
Is?,
"Let's just do that for now. So, average.",
"Let's just try something here. So, this is going to take the average ... So, the first one it's going to do ... Look, because it wouldn't work because it would do-",
"It would skip it. It would like spread it out. So, you have to do-",
"You'd have to do ... This is why I've been struggling because I'm like I can't. This is fucked because it has [inaudible 00:24:06] since you are only going to find it nine, you can just do the same thing nine times and then just do a tri-catch. And then you wouldn't have to worry about it but that's really inefficient like. So, it's like.",
"So, if you have average. So, the initial turn. It's going to be N array. It's going to be the first turn in the arrays. It's going to be first second and third fourth fifth. This is going to be-",
"No, I think I know how to simplify it.",
Yeah.,
That's something that I'm like I don't know how to convert that-,
"Yeah, I don't know how to.",
"Yeah. So, let's do N K plus zero.",
Yeah.,
"The average of K. Yeah, you're right.",
"Oh. So, what-",
"How would you do this? So, hold on. This is the value that has to change. K has to change and K's going to be here. So, it's made array of I-",
K.,
"So, this would basically set.",
I almost don't want to increase K.,
But I know you have to because you can't break the loop otherwise.,
"For now, I'm just going to comment to the side because I just kind of need this for like this is what we're trying to get to.",
"Oh, hold on, hold on. Hold on. This is going to do ... This is rows. This is columns. Hold on. Because this shouldn't have any coding. ",
Because this shouldn't have any coding.,
"This is dictating how many times this loops. So, what do we want this to be calculating in it's loop because this is going to calculating-",
"I think it should calculate the average per ... Oh, you know what you could do? You could do-",
Because this is going to have to be-,
Hmm?,
These are not-,

That's a thing?,

And then ...,
"So, just let me do ... Because you have to print. Let's just for seeing what it is at least. Like that?",
What's the-,
All right. What's this? Let's see what this gets us. That's in the print. That's an error in the print. That's not an error because I've gotten this before. It's an error in the print. It's got to be.,
Print this ...,

"Yeah, it's just getting it right. 18 divided by four is closest to 16 so four. So, it seems to be working.",
I'm going to spend the next 10 minutes storming out of here. I'm like how the hell does that work?,
Yeah.,
Equal to. ,
"Oh. Well, I'm just commenting [crosstalk 00:30:57].",
"Yeah, because this adds up the column.",
Because this is taking ... This is going to do an index zero. ,
"So, index zero is equal to ... So, originally this is going to be a zero and then zero and that's going to be zero one, zero two, zero three, zero four. So, it is adding the entries of a column.",
"Yeah, so this is adds up the column, stores it in ABG array. This-",
Average by the mid turns. [crosstalk 00:31:59]. I just I'm like I don't [crosstalk 00:32:04]. This ... Thank you. Thank you so much. Frick an A.,
I'm noticing a pattern here.,
Sweet.,
Holy fuck.,
This was a really hard one.,
"There was, I want to say like ... I worked with the other TA and there was one nested formula that we basically used four times for everything single thing that we learned.",
Mine's done completely.,
Yes.,
"Row, column, NEO.",
It does it from zero to nine because it's 9.99. Since N equals to nine.,
"Yeah, but we're trying to generate from zero to nine. This generates. This takes-",
"Zero to nine, I'm pretty sure. If it's one to nine I'll just add one to it. It's not horrible.",
"It might be. Yeah, it's one to nine. So, I'll just do nine and then I'll just add tack on a plus one to the end. Yeah.",
right?,
"So, what does [inaudible 00:39:24] do?",
How do you [inaudible 00:39:25]. How do you discard displaying the array like outright? Like to display a 2D array.,
Right here?,
Because how did you display the array? Because this is what I used.,
Because it's kind of sort of complicated to display it.,
Can you run it so I can see what you mean?,
"So, it's all zeroes.",
Are you filling it correctly?,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
It won't fill it with a number.,
Hold on. Can you put that back. Other way.,
NA. What is this NA? I'm just testing something.,
"Because I'm pretty sure you can't have that space, otherwise it doesn't change it. All right. Never mind.",
I never use the ... Did you import the-,
works.,
Did you import the random method?,
"Random R equals new method, new random.",
You got to put an S. ,
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). So, you got to do this whole thing in parenthesis and then run it and pull it. I mean, you got to cut it off before that turn.",
Oh.,
"This was a really hard one. I mean, like-",
figure out. Was it hard?,
I thought it was really hard. I wouldn't have gotten it without the other TA's help.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). On a side note, did you get an email from professor talking about my absence next week? I just want to check because I've been trying to get him to send a written letter so there's proof.",
I don't think he sent them yet but I've been reminding him because I need his official signature so I have official paperwork.,
Okay. It is Julio [Bahaman 00:43:31].,
"Yeah. Because so far none of my teachers have got anything and like I need this as soon as possible or it's going to cause problems. And so, also anyway I can make up the pole everywhere I'm going to not ... I'm going to be not there for?",
"So, do I get-",
"So, does mean automatic zeroes or like just invalidate them? Could we just invalidate them? Because the whole point is I'm just trying to get this as an excused absence. ",
I'm kind of like a little borderline though so I'm worried.,
That's good?,
"So, there's a hand written assignment or a paper I could write or anything? All right. Well, when you get an email with my 89.9-",
We'll talk about this again. I think I'll be seeing her. How many emails do you have? Honestly this is not even my own program. This was the back half is [inaudible 00:44:55]. Subject. N 20. This one was ... This one hurt my head dude.,
"Oh, it's easy. And then you try to figure out how to do it and you're like holy crap, why is this ... What is this bologna? Exits one. Oh, man, I almost forgot [inaudible 00:45:25] dorm. ",
I don't know. I'm like that describes today. I [inaudible 00:45:41] perfect. I don't understand. Go positive or I'll go neutral. It doesn't cost much. Question. Thank you. Helps a lot.,

Things got out of hand.,
I'm going to take these to him.,
"So, I was wrongly mistaken.",
,
Eight.,
Doing it.,
"So, I can just spread it out onto the floor. 'Cause I'm like sick and tired of balancing act every single part of this. ",
I didn't do it right. ,
Perfect.,
"What's the second part of this thing? Create a method and an average, this method gets a two dimensional arrays, includes calculates the average. Alright. ", 
"So, notice with 2D arrays, you literally just use this exact same formula every single time.",
"For doing anything with 2-dimensional arrays. All right, this is getting deleted",
"Yeah, I can see why they want us to put it in a method.",
"Cause so far my main method code consists of just this one line. Cause it's literally just gonna be, I think this works. If I do two by two. One, two, three, four, yeah it works.",
"No, it works, I just find it funny the main methods align. ",
"So, in the first method you're asking for the size of the array and to fill the array. In the second method, you're taking the average of it.",
"What I did is, this asks the user, how many rows you'd like? How many columns? Then, it fills it by saying how many would you like? Then, this one takes the average. But, the thing it requires a 2D array, which was made in this. So, what I did is I just put that method in the other method, so that this is gonna return a 2D array, and then this uses a 2D array. So, it just works.",
"And I looked at the wrong program. I let this thing, friggin' Hello World program. Class activities, New, Class Activity. Activity, for one mod for java.util. Public, static, void, main, string, parse ... ",
... shit.,
This should still work.,
Have like one column. One averages one ,
"Yeah. I basically did, once you're in the for loop, I had the array, and then the index would be the first for loop, and the second index would be the second for loop. So, it would be row, column, and then you do = input.next.",
"Activity, 812.",

... I've never seen gray before. ,
I've forgotten how to take a char as input.,
"So input.next.char? All right, I was missing the next. So, I'm gonna change this sign.",
"For the average, I would only use the same for loop, except I did average += whatever that index is, and then I add a counter. When WithIts, I get the end, I get average divided by the counter.  So, I use the same for loop.",

... 'ish. ,
I don't even know what I just did. ,
Alright. It works. ,
I just gotta comment it. ,
"Hey, it works. Finally. ",
Total 1. ,
,
I just finished. Anything you're stuck on?,
"Well, I think for starters, so your bread and butter, the 2D arrays. over here.  Your bread and butter is this loop format. You have just two nested loops. Where it's basically, this is how you're gonna iterate through your 2D array. This is gonna keep your of your columns, that's gonna keep track of your rows.",
"Collator. Like, do this later. I changed this like three times until I realized it had to be just this. ",
"Well, cause what you can do is in a method, you can still do, put a scanner in there.",
"You take input. So, what I did is I have this, ignore this for now. I made a method. It's supposed to generate an array, a 2D array. So, this is what it's gonna return, and this is what is required for it to run. If it doesn't require anything, then you just put it blank.",
No. It doesn't have any parameters at the moment.,
"Because, this is basically like, if you just type in, if I typed in just arrays that, it would run. It doesn't need any parameters. So, this first asks for your amount of rows, then amount of columns. This is gonna declare a 2D array with the amount of rows and columns. ",
"Ignore it. Don't go back up here for now. So this is, you've input here, you've got input here. You've got a rows value, and columns value. This is gonna declare a 2D array with that rows value, and that columns value. So, that's how big it is. This loop is the bread and butter. This iterates through your rows, this one iterates through your columns. This is how you iterate through a 2D array. What your gonna do is, you can interchange this. Like, literally every method you do with the 2D array is just gonna have this same base, and then something different in here. So, in this case, their supposed to enter in their own values. I'm basically taking ",
That's the size of the array. ,
"That's like do you want a [3,4] or a [12,5]. This is would you want an index [0,0]. Then, when it goes again, it will do you want to index [0,1]? This will populate the array. This is rows, that's columns. Basically gonna go, row 0, and then it's gonna do column 1, 2, 3, 4, whatever. Once that finishes, because that's basically taking the row length, once that finishes, it goes back up to here. This goes up to 2. Then it goes up to row 2, then 1,2,3,4, whatever. ",
"So, then after that, once this is all done, I return the array. Because, it's given me an array. At this point all you have is a 2D array with values that the user generated.",
"Well, for now, I'm just doing return to the array. So, the next we have to do is take an average. So, what you do is, you have to figure out before you do a method is, what are you gonna need to do that method, and what are you trying to get out of this method? So, for an average, you're trying to get a number. In order to take that average, I need a 2D array. So, what I did is, you take the parameter as the 2D array. So, this is just ",
This is just an array.,
"It's saying that the only thing that you need to make this method work is you need a 2D array to pull from. So, this is basically saying, when you refer to it, is gonna be looking for a 2D array. This is basically just an average encounter This is the same bread and butter loop, which is the same thing as that. Instead of having this in the middle, I basically had average+= whatever's at that spot. So, whatever's at index [0,0], and then [0,1], then [0,2]. That keeps adding it to the average, every time it loops, the counter goes up because that's gonna be the number of turns.",
"I'll get to that for a second. So, then it's just gonna return the average divided by the counter. Now, the big thing is, right now your program doesn't do anything, because the main methods not doing it. So, what you needed to do is, you know that you first need to call this method. Because this is how you're gonna get your 2D array. So, you schlop that on there, which is arrays. You then realize, that's the best one you're gonna need 2D array to pull from. So, this method is a gonna return a 2D array. So, you can just put",
What you need to do is put this method in the parameters for the other method.,
"So, this is gonna run. So, this is like at the moment, you have just this.",
"Yeah. So, this will run. That one returns the 2D array. So, this value is now 2D array. This requires a 2D array as the parameter, which this now will hold the value of a 2D array. So, this will now run. When this runs, it's gonna return an average, let's say 4. So, this whole method now just becomes the value, these combined methods just become the value 4. This just prints the averages 4. ",
"The problem with methods is you have to plan ahead, you have to know what you need to make the method, and what you need to return it. Because, what I could also do, the reason we have to keep it like that, I could just make another method here. But, it does a different 2D array. Then, over here, that means I can run this method succussfully with either of the new 2D arrays. It would give the average value. If you were gonna do ... ",
... If you were to do this for instance. You just gotta give it a size. ,
"Yeah, so if you did this, and you were to do average, if you were to do ... ",
"... and you were just to do test array, this works because this is a 2D array. This requires a 2D array to run. When this method results, it's gonna result in a 2D array. So, basically, this will always print 0 because that hasn't populated. But, if you were to run, you say how many rows, 2,2. Enter values. You'd be like 1,6,5,3. So, the average is 3, and this one the average is 0. That way you can have one method, which just calculates a specific thing. Then, you can just ",
"So, I can enter any 2D array I wanted into this average thing, and it will always run. That's how methods are useful. ",
"So, it takes the clump out of the main code, and it allows a reusable calculation. So, if you have to do something more than once, you can just call the method, and it will do it.",
You got it?,
"I will email you both of these, but I gotta head on out. But, I hope that helped.",
"The codes all commented as well. In programming there's always a billion ways to do everything. So, always find a way that works for you. ",
Alright. I will catch you later.,
" You got any questions, hit me up. Pretty much you may have noticed every time I had to do something with a 2D array, I did that double-nested for loop thing. Which basically iterate, that's just how you iterate it. If you had a similar. You'd do the exact same thing, except at only one point. That's just how you iterate it. Then, you can do everything else from there. ",
I'm gonna call it. This is signing off.,
