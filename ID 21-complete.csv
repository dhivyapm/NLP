I think it's recording now.,
Is there anything you want to say to the teachers before we start?,
"Dude, my head's right there.",
What would she do if we just hit the pause and did everything and then resumed it?,
Why true or false?,
What are you doing?,
Oh. You confused the hell out of me. Yeah.,
We have to entertain the teacher somehow.,
"No, it's the teacher listening. She has to listen to all of these.",
"It's disc golf, not frisbee golf. It's disc golf.",
"Yeah, we did last time. She had listen to him say ""fuck"" over and over and over.",
Our first recording. We didn't realize it and we were going off on a tangent.,
Describe your dinner last night in as many descriptive words as possible.,
That's a really uncomfortable word.,
The noodle was very moist as it entered my mou-,
That got better.,
You can't do it?,
That's what she said.,
"There you go. You started this, it's now a competition.",
Can you outline it for us?,
Like Sarah did last time. For me.,
I had it pretty much all done.,
I needed a lot of assistance.,
"If ... why would I do that? Wait, we have a problem with, we're connected to the same recorder, so he would have to come with me.",
"True, we would each be in a different stall. I don't care.",
Am I on the right track?,
Back to-,
"But I told him to enter one, two, three, four, five.",
Can we keep the pen?,
"Richard, it does come off. You just need to apply a certain amount of pressure to the right area.",
Carefully?,
What's up?,
How do you return a string?,
Return a string?,
What do you mean?,
How do you do this?,
Alright. Can we attach that magnitude?,
"Hey, I'll take the other half, I've got two of them.",
"Revenge is a bitch, isn't it? How many numbers have you pressed in my laptop lately?",
This isn't working. Are you doing part one or part two?,
"Oh, I know that's why I was trying to do it with just do one, two, three or four. And then you could figure out which one they're doing from that. But he's like, ""It has to be a string"". I don't want to do a string.",
I'm pretty sure that's what he said.,
"Richard, get what he has, put it on Discord send it to me and I'll distribute.",
Check the [crosstalk 00:14:06]. The bugs are coming.,
Careful.,
It would be a shame if it went missing.,
"Oh, I just did the first part.",
"Well, we can. Just say method.",
I've got a quarter of it done.,
Hang on.,
Careful?,
Here you go.,
I've been called worse things.,
"No, it's not.",
"I know, don't worry.",
"All it does is match A. So then you just have to fill int, I'm not sure how we do little B, but ...",
Are you talking to yourself?,
It's the only way he explained it. I don't know any methods.,
"What's a ""method""?",
It's how he explained it.,
Then do a method. Do you remember learning that?,
Does not.,
Where are we supposed to be looking?,
So you do the calculations in a method?,
And then we just print out in the if-else.,
So-,
I have it.,
"I have it, what you talking about.",
"I don't know, seven years of building computers, yeah. Cyber-security [crosstalk 00:25:10] yes. Programming, no, I've not used programming.",
"Do you want to show us the first part so we can understand what we're doing, cause I think the [crosstalk 00:25:18].",
The eight of us have no idea what we're doing.,
Six and a half.,
The method.,
"So, how would I do a method for square.",
"There's too many methods, but ok-",
You can turn up it's easy.,
So far.,
"We have to learn, not because it's easy.",
No.,
Go find that one semicolon that's caused it.,
Why are we doing int? Cause it could be a double.,
"No, it's difficult.",
Is switch int with double.,
"Essentially I could just delete where it says ""double a"" for all of these, and do the calculations down below. And that would pass.",
Cool.,
Yeah.,
"[crosstalk 00:30:24] Bro. Hey, Chris.",
"Yeah, but that means we have to redefine the scanner for each one.",
"Well, you're the one grading it, so ...",
You jackass. ,
What do you mean?,
Are you scared?,
What? What?,
"How do we do the mathematics for H to the underscore B? Height to bravo, or base. How are we supposed to do that?",
Is it depth?,
Just hit delete or backspace.,
Okay. That's just confusing. Why add all that?,
"And then for two parts, even though it says double N, do we have to double width, double height? And declare them in the parenthesis?",
"Yeah, so there is height and base, so I would have to do double-",
Oh yeah because I have it defined below. So then it's not required?,
No I did it all here.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative),
I did A equals square.,
I only did that because it's down there.,
Dude I'm way ahead of you.,
Oh shit. But I made Chris give up. I don't know if that's good or bad.,
Jesus. Wow.,
It's Sarah. What can you expect?,
That's why we make lab so much fun.,
"No, Jesus is.",
You can't beat Jesus.,
"Everyone needs Jesus in their life. Where did you ... Oh, it's down there. I was just like it fell off.",
Nope.,
Is it just A?,
Oh. I know. I just probably start with this.,
We have a lab?,
"Yeah, and then you do the same thing for the rest of them.",
Kind of looks like Pokemon.,
Don't serve me.,
I'll take it.,
"Dude, we've done it so much tonight, it doesn't even matter.",
Well all still have to do assignment two. It's due Sunday.,
That one. Somewhere right there.,
It doesn't work.,
It doesn't work.,
It doesn't fucking work.,
"Does it work if I spell circle right? Nope. Wow, Chris, doesn't work.",
That's supposed to be double. It doesn't like me.,
Many things don't like me. Sunlight doesn't like me. Turns me red.,
I don't think so.,
That doesn't make sense.,
"Chris, it doesn't work.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
Terrible.,
It takes the name and nothing else.,
Equal equal?,
I'm having a brain fart.,
What like ... Why is it doing that?,
Did you do the Chris part right on purpose?,
Still doesn't work.,
"Okay, now it works.",
I'm already done.,
I did it as a double just in case you put in a seven by five instead of a seven.,
"So, it's returning A which is square. So, I'm declaring double S equals square, which is what that is. So then S goes into the output.",
"On that, correct.",
Of course.,
Actually think I didn't do it.,
Life is not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to confuse you.,
"Yes, something more though.",
It's just near your face. We don't want that.,
Everything is awesome 21. ,
[crosstalk 00:48:59] why is this on my keyboard?,
You move.,
"No, you move that way.",
But your cord's in the way. You need to unplug it.,
Your cord.,
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I need to charge it.",
"Fine, move that way so I can move that way.",
So stupid.,
"Oh, god, everything's getting tangled.",
"Hey, Andrew. You can back up now.",
See? Now we've got the circle.,
What?,
"So, every time you talk you have to say everything is awesome. Into the mic, and then you keep talking because everything is awesome.",
Where is she?,
Everything is awesome?,
Awesome. Awesome.,
Awesome.,
That's because you closed it dumbass.,
None of this makes sense.,
None of it makes sense.,
No.,
That's the patient. What's the first thing that comes to your mind? Your face looks so constipated.,
I got it to work. Just kidding. It doesn't work. ,
Stop what.,
"Because man, look at this. That's an array. You're already failing.",
But how do we get an input in an array?,
"Well, if you take their cry closet away, you'll definitely offend them. What did I say?",
"If we take away the cry closet, the entire university would be pissed off.",
Cry closet because they can't cope.,
"Tommy, what crack are you on?",
What?,
That's an array right there. Right there.,
That's how you declare an array.,
I did it because we're not doing dot.,
Zero-,
We're already stumped. How do we do this?,
What's an array?,
"Nope, don't know how to do that yet.",
I know. I just wanted to create an array.,
Dipshit.,
Yes.,
That's how you define it.,
I don't want to define 10 all the way to 100. I feel like I'd be shooting myself.,
How do we do this?,
I already-,
What's an array?,
What's a pre-work?,
But you have to do 10 through 100.,
There you go.,
Stagnant.,
You get to hear everything he says later. Don't worry.,
Did I do this right? I don't know. I don't think so.,
Who wants to do this at home and make it due tomorrow?,
22 definitely said that. Talking to this somewhere. Did you get the set?,
You're leaving?,
"Yeah, I pointed that out to Chris.",
And he pointed it out to you.,
"Yeah, there is no homework.",
But there is no case study.,
We don't know what we're doing.,
Do you know what you're doing?,
Typically you just do it as an ENT.,
"Got two lines. It says enter number, and it captures the number. That's it.",
You said that already.,
10 seconds ago.,
Everything.,
Nothing.,
Is that supposed to be parentheses or bracket? [crosstalk 01:09:20].,
That's what you think.,
Is that supposed to be a bracket or parentheses?,
Does my loop at least look like? [crosstalk 01:10:14].,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
Okay.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
This is terrible. [crosstalk 01:11:08]. You haven't gotten very far at all.,
"Yeah, but I already had this, and then deleted it, because I thought I was wrong. [crosstalk 01:11:23]. ",
Everything is Awesome? [crosstalk 01:12:21]. What is number supposed to be? Just the random?,
What'd you do? [crosstalk 01:13:17].,
So-so? [crosstalk 01:13:33].,
That was so creepy. [crosstalk 01:13:34].,
"Dad, here turn it this way. I'll go quickly [crosstalk 01:13:46]. Or you just highlight it and copy paste. [crosstalk 01:13:55].",
It's just not going properly. [crosstalk 01:14:02].,
"I didn't want to say that. Doesn't go in properly. [crosstalk 01:14:20]. What you go there, bud?",
"[crosstalk 01:14:29], confused.",
I should just wait?,
I should just wait?,
What page? [crosstalk 01:14:59].,
"Dude, your echo doesn't look fun. Shuffle everything. [crosstalk 01:15:44]. Yeah, I can see it right here, but it still does not look fun, because I'm not gonna remember this for the test. What does this do? I don't know. [crosstalk 01:15:53].",
"That's skipping, because-",
Yeah.,
Put it this way-,
"You need a doctor's note for it to be excused. I was told that because I had a [crosstalk 01:16:17] reaction on Tuesday, and I was on Benadryl taking that test, and I was [crosstalk 01:16:22]. Then she was like, ""You need a doctor's note."" I'm like, ""I'm not going for the doctor."" [crosstalk 01:16:28].",
"Oh, I had an allergic reaction on Tuesday, and they said, ""You still have to come in for the test."" I'm like-",
You have to self medicate.,
What?,
Where's the input your [crosstalk 01:17:14] ...,
"Oh, how long do you want it to be? [crosstalk 01:17:21].",
What happens if you do 100?,
Do it.,
"Bear with her. [crosstalk 01:17:52]. I'll fucking get this shit. [crosstalk 01:18:30]. But it's in the book, I just don't understand what I'm looking at. What we need to do is in the book. I just don't understand what I'm looking at. [crosstalk 01:18:42].",
I hate this.,
"Dude, he just showed us a picture of his driver's license. [crosstalk 01:21:09]. It's hair here. No beard. [crosstalk 01:21:17].",
Can this be due tomorrow so we can ...,
I've got a headache already.,
I've got a headache. I can't go anymore. [crosstalk 01:22:48].,
"Because Chris is like, ""Oh, this is gonna be really easy,"" and the whole class is like, ""I don't get this."" [crosstalk 01:22:57].",
How are you feeling today? I need nicotine [crosstalk 01:23:17] withdrawal.,
That usually accompanies the withdrawal.,
"If we just copy this whole thing, will it work? Minus the Dallas bit. Ignore that.",
"It's in the book. [crosstalk 01:23:57]. Initializing with input, initializing with random numbers, displaying them, it says display [crosstalk 01:24:07] somewhere. Summoning all elements, and then the rest is ...",
Nothing. [crosstalk 01:24:20]. Oh man. If you knew what it was. [crosstalk 01:24:26].,
I could do all the way up to F. At F I'm just gonna throw it in the bin. [crosstalk 01:24:56].,
It's right here in the book. I just realized it.,
Said no one ever.,
"I forgot how to declare a new file, because [crosstalk 01:26:46] so brain dead.",
"I'm just gonna try to copy the book for everything it has, and see if it gets it, and it'll be done tomorrow because I've got a math placement test at 10:00 AM.",
"Let's just say the train was late arriving here, and I missed it by five minutes [crosstalk 01:27:45].",
We haven't even gotten to the last [crosstalk 01:28:14]. Can't do that.,
Is helping someone else.,
Toby needs food. [crosstalk 01:30:34].,
Just a little bit of curry. [crosstalk 01:30:38] curry. [crosstalk 01:30:41].,
"Toby, would you like more curry? [crosstalk 01:30:54].",
What? [crosstalk 01:32:00].,
"[inaudible 01:32:02] Toby, stay away from the curry.",
That's perfectly clean. [crosstalk 01:32:10].,
"All right, dude, I'm gonna go home.",
I'm not getting any further in this.,
You can stop [crosstalk 01:33:10].,
21?,
I think it's 21.,
Is it 21?,
What's my number?,
It is 21?,
I thought it was 23.,
I'm definitely 23. [crosstalk 01:37:18].,
Mine and yours. [crosstalk 01:37:45].,
This is my left hand. [crosstalk 01:37:57].,
What are you seeing?,
What if A and B equal C?,
"There's no C squared. It's just A and B equal C. [crosstalk 01:38:40]. Their plan has failed, epically. [crosstalk 01:38:44].",
I got the book.,
"Hey dude, we've got a group cohesion survey, and it's due on the 14th. We could do that easy.",
"Is it activity 18A? Yes, it is. [crosstalk 01:39:25].",
Some points of it.,
We can't. [crosstalk 01:39:59].,
Not yeet.,
No.,
Yeet. Someone asked for [crosstalk 01:40:40].,
There ain't an array.,
It says [inaudible 01:41:00] going for the next question. Keep the fuck up.,
"No shit, Sherlock, but we're using it for the next question.",
What the hell does part one do? Int array sets the array. [crosstalk 01:41:18]. [inaudible 01:41:26] array part two. [crosstalk 01:41:28]. True.,
Yes.,
They just try to mess you up because people will go in a linear fashion.,
"Oh, this is just saying some people will just ignore the comments that go one through ...",
Huh?,
It's just returning your values.,
"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",
Array is set to a new array.,
Or I can just type it out.,
Give me a moment.,
Currently attempting to figure out all the parts.,
Reference.,
Suck it!,
No.,
1.8,
"Set to the exact same one. Nah, it's set to a new array.",
I'm typing this stuff out so I have it in notes.,
So I have notes.,
"You miss one you automatically get a 90. Look at that, buddy. Reference the saints. Huh?",
Wait. What number are you on?,
"Right, but what number?",
"Me, too.",
"Oh, it's reference and same.",
Same.,
Same!,
"Good god, get a hearing aid.",
"Well then for whoever else who needs it. Or shit, there's another kid, I forgot.",
"Wait, what's question one?",
"Oh wait, am I just clearly just plugging and playing this?",
Hang on boys and girls.,
"Why don't we just check it. Before method, call 10, before method, call five. Let's just make my life easier. Pull up this cord.",
There you go.,
"Well, it's zero and one.",
Why not?,
"You know, the great thing is, she gets to listen to your mic. What did you learn? Things and objects. And she's gonna go ""Son of a bitch, I should have told him something easier.""",
"Do you wanna stand up first, and then sit down to make it easier on us?",
Lay down the lay. There she is.,
Shut the fuck up.,
"I wanna agree, but at the same time-",
"Bro, it's inside the method.",
"Eleven, space, five. Just look in discord.",
You got anything to throw at him? Like something that will give a solid mark?,
"See, I thought you were reaching for mine, which is actually full of liquid.",
Less is wasted.,
It is if he ducks.,
Space five. Yeah.,
Chris is awesome.,
Is David sick again?,
I don't trust him.,
Alright what's the correct? Just scroll down.,
"Hang on. Scroll up. Oh, five and six.",
Alright.,
Got it. Do you need the answers? Which number? This may be a while before we get back on track. What flavor jungle juice is better? Tropical or Mediterranean.,
Yeah.,
Reference.,
Just scroll up and down. I thought that's what nicotine was for?,
"Reference and same. Yeah, reference then same.",
"I'll make you feel worse. I can cook a meal meant for four people, sit here, and eat the whole thing in front of you. And you won't get a bite. And I'll still be hungry afterwards.",
I don't know where it goes.,
"Oh yeah, they have that. I've seen it.",
"No, there's an actual app in a way that like you can check what the parking levels are in all the decks.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative). It's not associated with UNCC. Someone just put it out there. It's on Reddit.,
For UNCC.,
No.,
"Hey man, I'm sitting right here.",
"Yeah, I think I ruined that for you. [crosstalk 02:10:02]",
Get most of them out of Ireland too.,
"Well yeah, I can see that.",
"Well I mean, I know both my great grandmothers came over on ships through Ellis Island, during World War II-ish. So no. 1900s ish. Somewhere in there. [crosstalk 02:11:39]",
"Ah, it froze. This stupid piece of shit. Oh, I did a paper on it.",
Due when?,
Yeah. No it's not.,
Sarah. Can you grab these from us?,
Because it's due at 8:15.,
,
21 what? ,
"Why is this question not in the book, the definition not in the book?",
Well you're going to have to read what a bubble versus a linear [crosstalk 00:01:20] actually is. Read between the lines.,
It's a lie.,
"There's key elements, sequentially with each.",
Linear... so compares key elements sequentially with each element is linear and then the second part is binary.,
Yeah. The one [inaudible 00:02:09] rocket ship.,
It's a little more than a quiz.,
"I'm searching... 43, 44.",
Linear then binary.,
It's rubbing against...,
I haven't gotten there. Maybe the first though.,
"What the hell is this? Well, it's not-",
Why is it not showing?,
"Oh, there's nothing. ",
Can you just undo the wire so they can sit separate?,
That's not my problem.,
"Yeah, it's linear. ",
Because it matches exactly what I have.,
Three is linear.,
"Capital S, capital S.",
Searching.,
[inaudible 00:05:06],
No. ,
[inaudible 00:05:28] is not calling anything.,
Did you? I don't remember.,
"Oh, he's ahead of us.",
Congrats. He doesn't have any horses.,
[inaudible 00:07:10],
"Yes, seven is binary.",
He's just good at math.,
What?,
[inaudible 00:08:14],
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
"At the same time I feel like this is doing it wrong because this should be in here, that way it pulls it.",
"No because it's pulling this [inaudible 00:09:15] right there, so now it's fine.",
We're stuck on [inaudible 00:09:34].,
It is in the main method.,
Main.,
"Because it's just doing mystery method which comes here, so it shoots through here and then it comes back and prints it out.",
"Well, from the last class that we had that's no surprise.",
It shouldn't be wrong because it's the same as this. And this is straight from the book.,
You can just minimize this if needed.,
"No, that's right.",
Because lab 01 is what mine's named.,
[inaudible 00:11:37] one for Andrew.,
You can still be tired.,
Chris!,
Do you want me just give it to you and you can sit down behind here?,
The bubble code is wrong.,
Is the middle name Madison?,
Is the middle name Madison?,
"But ironically, the code above is from the book, so it's got to be this.",
Nine is D.,
Scroll up. Go up the-,
Can you teach it to us online?,
"[crosstalk 00:14:54] another way, we can understand this way. And then, for the assignment [crosstalk 00:14:57]",
"Actually no, David was sitting at his laptop.",
You're scrunching up the eye. That's what Sarah did.,
Or just do ALT-TAB to look at the browser.,
Now we got a negative one.,
Or we just do compile air because it's wrong either way.,
"Well, we got three tries. Wait, is it going to tell us what's wrong?",
"Yeah, there's three attempts.",
But it's still nice to know which one's the right way.,
"No, no, no, no, no, this is not astronomy.",
"See, the sad part is we found it the other day, so please, come find it again.",
Eight is negative one.,
"So then, what's nine?",
The array wasn't sorted to begin with.,
They're not going to come back here.,
"All right, Chris will.",
Even though there is no middle.,
There is eight numbers.,
Is our recorder still on?,
"Right, because when Aizeya is like ""Our recorder is turned off"", I'm like ""Now, [inaudible 00:19:10]""",
"Hey, just what you guys did with ten? Max, what's ten?",
Fuck you.,
What's eleven?,
Oh.,
First.,
"Oh no, it's okay.",
"Oh. Because I saw smallest latest, I'm like, ""Why is he saying-",
"Wait what? And then you're like, ""Smallest first"" to him and I'm like, ""Ah.""",
It's not in the book!,
"Oh wait, it is in the book.",
Multiple phases.,
Neighboring.,
[crosstalk 00:21:00],
I'll wait for Sarah to come back over here before I raise my hand. David's a little bee.,
Nope.,
He's WoW and I play Sea of Thieves or Battlefield 4.,
"Sorry, buddy. I'm not [crosstalk 00:21:31]",
And?,
And?,
"Yeah, but I'd rather meet people with real jobs making six figures than nerds playing games.",
But they have no real life skills because all they do is play games.,
"No, it's not.",
It's entertaining to watch how little life skills they have after the game's done.,
Your definition of entertaining...,
No.,
"Yeah, but I don't watch sports.",
"Well, sports and E-sports.",
I'm on 14.,
What's wrong with the-,
"Oh, it's missing a bracket.",
Is that a beat?,
"Surprise, it's not drawing anything.",
I don't know what the fuck it does.,
It's different from what the book has.,
It's different from the book.,
These are both from the book. This is- I don't know what that is.,
I don't recognize it.,
"So, it is bubble-",
In that picture I'm the bubble ass. I don't know.,
What was the question here after the TA?,
"This is a bubble, right? Because I got the bubble sort right here. Is that a bubble sort?",
I don't know.,
It's different from the book.,
It is.,
"This is a bubble sort. No, I don't know.",
Can you tell us what it's not?,
I don't know what it looks like because it's different from the book.,
"Very different. And the sad part is this is the selection and this is the bubble. So, it's different from [inaudible 00:24:49].",
[inaudible 00:24:51] bubble.,
I don't remember.,
"No, it's [crosstalk 00:25:36]",
"No, I hate this. Get rid of this.",
I don't want to do it.,
No.,
I don't want to do this.,
Shut up! What?,
"Oh yeah, that's right.",
"Yeah, it is. Wait, wait, wait, we missed one.",
It is?,
"Well, what's a merge sort?",
I read over it.,
No. That's selection.,
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, because that's selection right here.",
"Don't expect that to- Well, how- What's 15?",
It's the same thing with 17.,
Is this even right code? How do we know this is going to work?,
"What's question ten? Oh, I don't want to know that.",
Why don't we just do this at home?,
What?,
"[inaudible 00:27:07] class at 8:15, [inaudible 00:27:08] 45 fucking minutes to get home.",
Let's get this chicken.,
"So, I'm [inaudible 00:27:21] for ten.",
What you got for nine?,
"Turn around, you can get a rest of it.",
"I'm just being sarcastic, we only have ten, we're only missing three but she hasn't gotten to nine, so I'm telling her to turn around and join the collective that is not Azaya.",
Isaac.,
Bubble. What's going on with my life?,
Take the L in time.,
Not bubble sort.,
What is this? I don't know what [inaudible 00:28:36] What's going on?,
Get the fuck out.,
I don't know what 17 is even asking me.,
"Yo, [inaudible 00:29:05] what's going on?",
I feel like it's missing something.,
"Yeah, but where are we supposed to call?",
Okay.,
"I can't. Oh, I have to do what I did with my assignment.",
No!,
It's not working.,
I'm not understanding this.,
Shut up! Who knows what's going on? I don't!,
Fuck this shit. I'm doing it this way.,
It's not working.,
"See, I added that which is from that but it's not working.",
Can we just take the L?,
Fuck my life. I'll take the L.,
Do you know it's going to suck if it doesn't show me what I did wrong?,
It doesn't show what I did wrong.,
What?,
"Oh, it's because it's multiple parts. See? Multiple parts in it, 0-5 that's why.",
"And almost on point [inaudible 00:32:33]. Wait, what's number one?",
I did but I'm retaking it.,
"What's number three? Oh, it's- Go.",
Four. One. Five.,
"Okay, [crosstalk 00:33:59]",
"I tried it, it does not work.",
"No, no, no, no, no, why give us code if we can't fix it?",
"Man, I don't have [crosstalk 00:34:23]",
"Put it this way, if it's wrong it's a 14 out of 29?",
[inaudible 00:34:49] up my grade. This has dropped my grade.,
"Uh, no, I fucked up his poll.",
He got a 75.,
[inaudible 00:35:05] a minute every time and then she gives us 30 seconds for the first three.,
"Well, it's like [inaudible 00:35:11]",
"I'm like, ""Hmm.""",
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait what?",
Of what number? Of what number?,
Oh.,
I feel like you're making this shit up.,
Oh.,
"Wait, wait, wait.",
No.,
They're all there.,
Here.,
"Oh, I know but-",
"Wait, what's 15?",
I forgot the last two.,
Damn it. The wrong one.,
What's ten?,
You forgot a number.,
"Toby, what's ten?",
"Toby, just take it and then tell it to the rest.",
"Step one, the equal three. Toby, read it out loud.",
2-1.,
"Six. Toby, what's three?",
Smaller or larger?,
Eight as we finish the last.,
Smaller.,
What's step seven?,
"Wait, step seven is less or higher? Oh, nevermind. Amid.",
"Oh, smaller.",
2-1-6.,
I believe we didn't need. Are you good?,
Because we're missing with six.,
You just added the six to the end of them.,
I'm doing what you're doing.,
What if we just two[crosstalk 00:40:25],
"So, what if we did- In eye, see where it says equal zero? Change that to two.",
"Oh, that was unreal.",
"Yeah, it's because I forgot the array. No, that one. I know what I did.",
"Wait, come back here.",
"Got it. Hahaha! Bro, you're wrong.",
"I got them, threw them all and I'll share them.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
8-6-7-9.,
[inaudible 00:42:33] won the last one.,
21? Why are you sticking this near my mouth? 21? 21 or 22? I don't remember.,
Are you sure?,
Or 43? What about 43?,
I though you were 45 and I was 46?,
"  I'm just waiting for him to walk in here with wings, and everyone go, wah?",
What high school?,
"Nevermind. Dude, he's wearing a shirt with eggs and bacon on it. ",
I'll be his partner.,
He's getting some food.,
"Dry rub, wet rub, who knows?",
What happened?,
So I should cut your food?,
And this is why I get so prepared for the-,
Chase try the link I just sent you.,
For the book.,
I knocked it over.,
Fixed it. Is that the link you have?,
Cause the website? I just went to it I looked.,
I got two of them open.,
Works for me.,
Yeah.,
"So, he doesn't have to lug around a giant book.",
You'll get some comments in from him for chatting with each other.,
"Oh, it's right behind where you are.",
"[crosstalk 00:09:27], What you need to do is tell them to meet you outside Woodward Hall on Cameron Blvd. Right before the intersection where they're building.",
They probably don't even think anything of it.,
"So, I found out an easier way than having to do[inaudible 00:10:45].",
Do you know what to do? You just do this.,
"One line, and it counts for row and column.",
I don't know I haven't gotten it to work yet.,
"No, he's stretching it Chris.",
"Here, Chris.",
Line 19.,
Suck it.,
[crosstalk 00:13:14] I don't know how he is still alive right now.,
"What? Ask what? Yeah, how long did it take to grow your hair? How long has it been since you had your picture I.D. taken until now? Couple years? There yeah go, two years. ",
That requires you to have a brain.,
"Oh, no we need to fill in this first,[crosstalk 00:20:24]. Wow, I thought it was random for the column and the row number. Okay.",
For almost all of it? Or just [inaudible 00:22:31].,
"Then I read that wrong as well, cause I thought we had to do another method where the ray was in there and then tie it into the main, and I was like, I'm going to shoot myself with this.",
"Man, I'm so glad I ordered my food before class, I just kill them all right now.",
Dude class is almost over.,
Add the star between the parenthesis and the nine.,
"So, it's plus two because the numbers have to, the rows and columns have to be between two and nine.",
"Yeah, so you multiply it by nine.",
I thought it was because it went between two and nine.,
"Yeah, but look at this math after random. Nine minus two plus one plus two.",
"So yours is, nine plus two minus two plus two?",
It does the same thing.,
That has a one in it.,
That shouldn't have a ones.,
Thanks. This is 12. Chase what was yours? Nine plus two minus one plus two?,
"All right, it seems to be fine. Yeah, but then we have to do a four loop for adding all the columns, each one has to be displayed. And then we have to do the total sum of all the numbers in it. No, for the whole thing, so all the columns together is the final sum after displaying that column A through whatever are these are all the averages, and this is average for all the numbers together.",
"Good God man. I thought that was on your head, I was like, holy shit no wonder he's deaf.",
"Well, that's what I gave you.",
"That's what I gave you. That will print it if you just put in your modified arithmetic, and then all we have to do left is do a four loop for the sum of each column, and then the sum of all the numbers together.",
"And then if you keep everything as [inaudible 00:31:23] it will make your life a little easier, hopefully.",
You can see how original I am.,
[inaudible 00:32:12].,
"You can put it inside of the array and then shoot yourself. Chase all we need is for her to say, ""yeah we'll extend it.""",
Dude I'm about to fall asleep.,
I can't think anymore. Do you want some Teddy Grahams?,
Yup.,
"Well, I was just creating it underneath, so i equals zero, and just do it as i.",
Chris! Question.,
[inaudible 00:38:30],
"Where should we figure out the sums? Cause I was going to put it at the end, but he's thinking of adding it.",
"Row, column.",
"Okay, so if it's m and n, m is rows going down, n is columns.",
Yeah.,
"No, it's got to be the same.",
In Java the rows are done first cause its two dimensional array.,
Yes.,
"Yeah, where should we be putting the four loop to figure out the arrays sum for each column? And the average. I don't know, I'm trying to figure out put it at the end of the whole thing.",
"Well, don't we have to put it in an array?",
"It goes rows first, I know that.",
It's supposed to be two by nine.,
Is this going to be a lot to do later tonight? Cause-,
"Oh damn, tomorrow, because we only have ten minutes left.",
Yes.,
I mean you could pull that one from the bottom if you want.,
How loops are you right now? Nevermind that's a stupid question.,
Someones got to be punny.,
"Ah, it's the second one. Yeah I know, I did that for the longest time cause I hate it.",
"Dude, I can't believe that actually worked. Is that the 15% [inaudible 00:46:23].",
Do these windows open? So I can through food out of it? Please?,
"Ah, with enough pressure, yes.",
So now you have to copy this and...,
Brackets?,
Does this also do the accumulative?,
"You did it like that? I was like, oh my god.",
Do it again.,
It will give you an extra y and the extra y is.,
"Hey, Chris! Can you take these things?",
"22, I think it's 22. Is it 23?",
"Well I thought I was 23, you're 22. ",
That's what I just said. ,
Why did I think I was 23?,
Always been 21?,
"I'm messing with you. I am 21, and it's activity 21. It's like fate",
I'm still not gonna get it. (laughs),
"Ha ha ha let me just take that off your hands. All right Ethan, turn around, Ethan, face the group. ",
There you go. We're all inclusive. Emily is way over there. ,
What time? ,
"The time stamp is always important. Day, year, month, and time. ",
Time. ,
Start 8:64. ,
I have no idea. I tried it twice yesterday and I just couldn't find the minimum. ,
Ha ha ha don't do that. ,
"Uh, [inaudible 00:03:13] [crosstalk 00:03:13] Is that bubblegum. ",
What? ,
What? ,
It just tastes like bacon juice without anything in it?,
I'm not 45. ,
"You get one more, yes. ",
It was on comedy central. ,
"No, I'm being serious. ",
The super troopers. ,
"So there is three dudes in the car in the beginning, I can actually just show it to you. ",
"Cops pass and they're like, ""quick! Eat all of these mushrooms! And while you're at it, can you swallow all this weed?"" So he's got it all in him",
And then the cops talk to him and he's just like ,
"[crosstalk 00:05:33] hits him. He doesn't see it coming. Whoa ho. And then they get arrested at some point. And then another vehicle goes by and then they chase the car and they get to a bar. They leave the three guys, the three [crosstalk 00:05:49] [inaudible 00:05:49]. And the fucking kite is licking the glass that's separates them and says the snowberries tastes like snowberries, Man!",
"That's the greatest thing. She's gonna listen to it later and she's gonna hear ""that better be Zyrtec"" and you're just gonna be like ""I hope so."" ",
Yes. ,
"and that's why I was like ""I'm not gonna say it""",
Dot I hate this ,
Come closer Emily. ,
"She's kinda, when these two are left alone. And then we've got like the circle of ",
All right here. Ethan. ,
"Ethan, you move next to Emily, and Max will come over.  [crosstalk 00:07:43]",
What are you dong?,
Scoot over. So max can come join the circle. ,
Watch out. There are a couple outlets between you and here. ,
Can I get a bowl with It's bone pizza. ,
Bring your birth certificate. ,
"Bring everything, everything. ",
Who wants a boneless pizza?,
a boneless pizza?,
They are recording that I am selling them on Ebay. ,
Do you not understand me?,
State that again in the con voice. ,
What are they doing? Why are they all lifted down?,
What are they doing?,
That's terrible. ,
I don't think we're going to get anything done today. ,
Do us a favor and shut up? ,
In my pocket. In front of the vending machine. ,
Like they're saying ill give you a raise.[crosstalk 00:13:18] [inaudible 00:13:19],
I'm waiting to see [crosstalk 00:13:28] [inaudible 00:13:28],
"Dude, I got hit by a baseball in the throat. ",
I'm trying to figure out the second one. ,
Did you just get sucked into the void or something? Like?,
Why is it shitty?,
"Why can't you people just get like a vape, like normal idiots? ",
"Yeah, Noah what conditioner do you use? ",
Nice ,
"Wait a minute, that's already taken care of. ",
You guys are just gonna keep these back for use. ,
"Yo, we try to have an extravagant conversation, just to see how long it will take for her to say ""All right, you guys just don't get this anymore""",
What? The second one? ,
That's what she said. ,
"But then when she walks away, we'll all be like Sarah! And then she'll come back and it'll kinda be like...",
"Hey, hey, hey. Every time",
Carefully. ,
"[crosstalk 00:20:29] see it's supposed to do this, but it doesn't do this at all. Cause then",
"He's smart, go with him. ",
We make jokes about him. ,
Mm-hmm (affirmative) ,
"All right, I need help. But Chris can't give me the level of help. ",
"[crosstalk 00:22:05] Don't worry, I'll be here at like 8:00 am on Friday, Chris. ",
"But we just get there at 8, so. ",
The black hole? ,
"The best prank to do is take a blue pill, take a blue power aid. Take the power ade, drop the pill in, close it, give it to your buddies. ",
"There's actually, ill have to find it on YouTube but there's. Public, static, void, and then I don't know. This is what I used, but if it's for a number verses. ",
He has enough problems as is. ,
Where do we start? (laughs),
"Oh, come on! Are you serious. ",
See he sits behind the desk and I come talk to him when he gets bored. ,
I'm gonna get here at like 7:30 on Friday. ,
Wednesday? That might have been it man,
That sounds like a lot of sarcasm. ,
"Yeah once you ruined it, I was just like you guys are the light of my life. I'm just like, sarcasm! ",
I don't know what's going on because I haven't really been taught much.,
Cause I'm looking up. Oh I forgot yours was touch screen ,
Return? ,
Yep. And then you just put the name above. ,
I need more crack. ,
"How much are you looking for? A couple ounces, a couple milligrams? ",
You want one? ,
Have you ever had a nerd rope? ,
"I think so, this is a little easier to eat. ",
"Emily, I have biology next semester. A d I'm just like, this is going to be a whole new hell that I've never done. ",
"You need one up here too because look, that's your error right there. ",
"Crushed red pepper, yes. I thought he meant black pepper. ",
Why don't we just take activity 20 and cut it into piece and then just add in what we need. ,
That's what I just did. ,
That was me trying really hard not to sneeze and then I released it. ,
"We had a, I actually had a co-worker that would refer to himself and be like ""Brandon Tucker does not like how you're talking to him"" and I was like "" Brandon Tucker needs to shut the fuck up. ",
What is it called. ,
Toby. ,
"Yeah it was to the point where he was like ""Brandon Tucker shouldn't have to do this, Brandon Tucker didn't have to deal with this at his old job"" Brandon Tucker should stop talking in the third person. ",
Come back into the circle of life that is currently the circle of confusion. ,
Equal to shit? I didn't know it was that easy. ,
You look so captivated like that. You're so captivated listening to her. Keep going. ,
What! He didn't finish.,
You got a couple years to enjoy it. ,
"Sarah, can we get this extended to be due tomorrow because it's almost 8 o'clock and we're not very far into this? ",
Could we just get it extended now so the rest of us can go home? ,
Its a lot but it's due at 8:15. ,
"Oh, it's unlocked. ",
"No, 20 was randomized rows and columns and fill in the middle and then it would give you the sum of each column and then the sum of all the columns. So what I'm saying here is take that, cut the array into it's own. ",
"Dude that would be entertaining, because I always, I have one person that I know. ",
"Sarah, don't say that. ",
"Um yeah, but put it this way, I was much skinnier and much smaller. Yeah, so Max I went to great clips, well my mother took me there and was like "" take a little off the top"" because my hair WAs like this. Dude just goes whoomp. I looked like I came straight out of Auschwitz. ",
Its too late. ,
What are you doing? ,
"Aww poor you, buddy. ",
"I'm gonna probably say no, but keep going",
Mm-hmm (affirmative),
Probably cause you can't just put array. You have to declare what it is. ,
"Yeah, but like, mine is a terrible example because there is very little there, but, so I did the array, in it's own method to make my life easier. ",
And I just called it up there. And ill put it right there. And I actually did something that worked and I don't know how I did it now. ,
Ohhhh. ,
"Wait, scroll all the way up. Hmm. Was gonna say, if you want put that as like a static. Because then you can use it anyway.",
"Ask the teacher, she is right here. ",
All of it? (laughs) ,
Why you got to sit in the corner? This is like the worst place for you. ,
You need professional help. ,
"Yeah, I can't find it on campus. ",
"I just need like a puppy okay, ",
Only during finals week and you have to be there thirty minutes before it starts because the line . ,
"Yeah, I saw that online and I was like you gotta be joking and then she was like, yep, that's very popular. Ill just bring my dog and it can pee everywhere. ",
You should put in how many rows and how many columns and it just puts out what would be in between. ,
"Did you start using it yet, or is it just the start up? ",
I don't know what that does to you. ,
"What does that? Well, the easiest way to clean out your sinuses is to go to Harris teeter and go to the hot pepper sauce, get the dragon pepper, well, ill bring it in tomorrow if needed. Just a little bit on your pinky, it will clean your sinuses out in seconds. Its wonderful. It lasts for three hours. We used it at work, I brought in a bottle and we all were like, and all of us for five minutes straight were just blowing our noses and then we're like, we can smell. For three hours we were good and then played start building up and then do it again. ",
"And you're just like trapping them. They come in and you're just like, you don't know how to give them back up. ",
On a TA?,
Yeah. ,
"Um. I hate this desk. Dude my hamstrings are tight. Yeah, but I don't want to be sitting like this. ",
Well this is also the guy who cracked it once with. ,
G fuel is what you should be drinking?,
"Yeah, but how is it better?",
I just realized I've been pushing yourself backwards. Makes a lot of sense. ,
"I don't think it's kicked in yet, yeah it has kicked in. ",
I skipped part one thought.,
"That's how I called it, see at the top, how it is just array.",
"I am a very slow worker, and there is a lot of sugar. Man I can feel the sugar. Yeah, Max that is as far as I got. I can fill it with zeros, does that count? ",
Zero. And total ,
I'm kinda tempted tot do the coding boot camp over the summer so I can be better at it. ,
"One, two, oh shit. Go all the way through the fucking alphabet. Numbers. When you hit nine, then go backwards. Eight. ",
We're gonna be at this for a while. Why did you let me pick. ,
Oh. ,
"Wait, do it again. One, two by three. One, two, four, four, four, five, seven, ",
"Okay, do what ever. ",
"12,14,13,12,14,13",
Quit your wining because I'm right. ,
Either way your math sucks. You're supposed to be dividing by the number of columns. So it's divided by three. Either way it's wrong. ,
Should we get this disabled?,
"Emily, you look like you are about to fall asleep. ",
"Well, I'm like, I know that thing, but she's like ",
Why od you have to bring that up? We know it's broken. Is it like one of those things like when it's slightly off by the spelling and you have to bring it up every time for vision. ,
That's how I can say that. ,
See that's where I would just do an HDMI cord. ,
An hour? ,
"Ooo a senior exit project? Yeah, that sucks. ",
Mine was I did needle project and I never had to do a senior exit project. ,
In south Carolina (gasps) ,
I'm still a bean. ,
"I've got Scoliosis, so if you straighten my spine I'm 6'5"" ",
"Ha ha 6' 8"" Jesus Christ. ",
Aww stop it. ,
"Yeah, when I was in high school, I was 6'2"" and 130 and I was stuck like that for eight years",
"I was about 5'7"", 5' 8"" in high school, I mean middle school ",
"Dude, my growth spurt was so painful, yeah. Yeah because my legs were growing at a rate that my knee caps couldn't keep up. ",
"No, it would be in the middle of the day. Like I would get home from school and I would just sit on the floor because it hurt so much. ",
There we go. ,
Chris can you take these. ,
"We're not allowed to turn it off, right?",
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
21,
I know. Sarah added you  ,
As the prophecy foretold. ,
We should be able to change his nickname. ,
There you go. ,
It was Jesus for all of five seconds and then you changed it. This is terrible. ,
The what?,
He's got to set up the long way.,
Just got to be creative. ,
Just put it on the ledge behind him. ,
You're welcome. That's why they pay me the big money. ,
"Chase, just put it in your hoodie. ",
"Yeah, say your numbers. ",
I'm guard 21. ,
"Well, we don't have lab and I don't have the night class. ",
Our lab is canceled.,
Yeah. We're free on Fridays.,
"Well this Friday, not next Friday. This Friday we're good. ",
27 so I think that counts for ... ,
27. I know. I have friends a lot younger than me. This feels weird. I work with people all ,
"Yet with my mental age, I fit in perfectly.",
We know Isaiah's favorite work is nicotine. ,
I try not to curse. So I'm just going to go. ,
I was not fucking. ,
you free on Friday? Are you free on Friday?,
How about Saturday?,
After 3 o'clock. ,
I'm free all the time everyday. Life of a student. ,
"I don't know, the paycheck's a lot nicer. ",
Hey buddy. Man I hope she doesn't listen to this tomorrow. ,
"You know what would be more fun, just come in with a bottle of Tito's but have it be water and just be drinking out of it. See how long it takes for someone to go, ""Um.""",
That might be a little too sensitive right now. ,
No. No.,
"If anything, I'll just bring in Cards Against Humanity, we could just play that in the back. ",
"I've got enough, that way the whole class could play. We'd still have extra cards. ",
No but I've got the.,
"Hey guys, it's Good Friday. Let's get lit. Come to the bridge. Come underneath the bridge where the tent fire is. ",
It's Good Friday. ,
I've been looking at this loop for like 10 minutes because I don't know what to put in it. ,
I'm off on Friday. ,
"I've printed the slot machine, now I have need to put ones in it. ",
"Yeah, Friday mornings. You always work Friday morning. Got to wash those dishes. ",
It's either a zero or a one. ,
"This sets us up for doing part of assignment four. If we can get this, then we come start designing. The character has to start at 00, which is the top left corner. Then you chose, do you want to move left, right, up, down. You encounter an animal or you don't and you keep going until the person quits. So this will set it up. ",
It's also due in 12 days. It's due on the 28th. You need to play catch up. ,
"Well, you're going to ditch that birthday. You're going to come party with us Friday.",
"Oh yeah. It's Good Friday. We have Friday off, no lab. So we're going to get drunk and play Cards Against Humanity or something. I know. It's like, shoot, where'd it go? ",
"No, we're just doing this. ",
By all of six inches. Maybe a foot. Foot and a half. ,
It's times nine right?,
Times nine. Got it. That was easy. ,
Like that. ,
I'm going to do a just to test it. ,
"We can just look to our left and see it. Because it also lets you, if she has a doodle pad she can just write it. ",
"Because I was like, we have to do a four loop and then it has to repeat. ",
Wait. That's got to be inside my four loop. ,
"Wait, does it have to be in another method?",
Redundant actually. ,
Oh my God I forgot how to do a random number. ,
Was that the start of a loopy. Was that what that was?,
That's all I remember. ,
I made it that far. ,
It's one minus zero? One plus zero? Max and min it's one over zero. ,
Main ray.,
"I was hoping I could get it while you were typing. You just keep going and be like, ""Where's the error."" Role call. ",
Y times 10 because it's supposed to be a one or a zero. ,
So am I basically doing the ...,
I've been using that for nine hours today. ,
To win the game it has to line up. ,
Vertically. Not horizontal. They can't line up horizontal. Good luck doing it diagonal because that just sounds painful. Especially for your first attempt. ,
"Well I've got a problem now, it's generating more than nine ones. ",
You've got a major lemon?,
Why?,
Thank you. At least someone's not lazy like the rest of us. ,
I said at least someone's not lazy like the rest of us. ,
Scallywag. ,
Yes. ,
I've seen the peaches. ,
Where are they?,
Oh my God this thing's like so warm. He was using my charger because his phone almost died. Thing is just so warm.,
You actually got it to work?,
"All right Chris, where do I go from here? I'm trying to get it to generate. ",
"She's like, ""You can do the rest."" I'm like, ""I don't know.""",
"Wait, call?",
Oh I did it. I did it. Yeah. ,
Hey Chris I'm a dammit genius. I just did it. First try. ,
"I was like, where are you going with this? Yup. ",
Oh just do display. But will that repeat it as well?,
Well I did more than. ,
Oh is it because I have display right there? I was doing one on top of the other. ,
It's supposed to be a five by nine. That's a lot more than five. ,
So do I really have to give them the option to hit enter. Can I just do it this way?,
So how far have you gotten? I haven't started. Okay. ,
Good God man. I got to squint to look at it. I might as well be squinting at it over there.,
Might get a couple heads there as well. ,
I did it without the enter. ,
I did this without realizing it would do that. ,
I don't know what I did either. ,
So it just displays the array. ,
What? Right here. Tristan. Callie.,
Scallywag. ,
His last name's Scallion so they just call him scallywag. ,
"She's gong to hear herself and then she's going to hear you go, ""Hey. I have no idea what she just said to me.""",
I know. ,
That was terrible. ,
"That way it would work between them. That's why it's the light brown. Where did oh, she's way over there. ",
"I have to explain to a non-computer user how to reset her computer.  No, but it's resetting the pram on a MacBook. That way it fixes ...",
"Well hey, if you really want to. I already did five for you. It works. ",
Yes it does. ,
Yup. ,
What do you mean? ,
It puts the one in aray into place and says press enter. You don't have to do any work at all. ,
"Yes, show me what I did wrong because Chris won't. ",
What?,
Because they're smarter than us. ,
I am. That's why I said us. They're smarter than me and us. ,
No you don't. ,
"Do shift home. Shift home. Then you just hit, up, up, up, done. ",
Thank you. ,
"Yeah, but now I have to do it to the point where it checks to see if it lines up correctly. Either you win or you don't win. ",
"Oh, no I did it wrong. Chase, I've done it wrong. ",
"So it prints it the first time. When you hit enter it goes, you didn't win. ",
"You know I don't think of these things, right? ",
It works. Even though ... ,
"Technically this is me, this is me, this is Sarah, this is Chris. ",
Because mines better. ,
No one likes change. It's okay. ,
Yours done?,
Your code.,
Do you want to see mine?,
Should I be putting the code with the discord from now on?,
I don't really care enough. It allows you to check it when I'm not here. I learn off of looking at what you've done and then changing it. ,
It's like when I play with a computer. I'll take the whole thing apart and then rebuild it and then I understand. ,
"I'd just do zero to two, or zero to three and make it ...",
Zero to four and it has to line up with three. ,
Which is why we don't even give him the ability. ,
Loser is the next user. Have you ever hear of ...,
"It's the bastard operator from hell is the system admin on a campus who just fuck entirely with ever other user. He'll delete like, half the print queue and there'll be a line of students waiting for their stuff to come out. ",
Oh my God. ,
There you go. I put the first one in ...,
Did you just call me Chris?,
I'm going to take it as a compliment though. ,
I already printed out six arrays without meaning to. I was just trying to get one to appear. ,
This is going to be great when she has to listen to all of this. ,
"She hears silence. Suck my butt. Number 22 is vulgar. Creative, but vulgar. ",
Because it's the parentheses times nine because it does zero to one so you're multiplying. ,
We don't have class tomorrow together. You're talking about Thursday. ,
"I've got our bullshit class. Then we go to lunch. Then I've got sociology. Dude. I ripped my teacher a new one yesterday. That was great. He took off points because I changed up how the PowerPoint goes. I'm like, in an email, ""So you're taking points off for being different?"" I wanted to add on, ""Have the last 60 years not helped you with anything?"" But I was like that may be too far. ",
"He's on borderline racist everyday. He was like, all terrorists are from the Middle East. Aggressiveness is due in part due to firearms. ",
Damn it. ,
Great. You're part of the free folk. We're screwed. ,
Man you got nothing. ,
Because when I did the close parentheses it jumped. ,
What?,
How do you change the colors? I forgot how. ,
Color. ,
Mine came like that. I don't know. ,
Thank you. ,
"Oh, syntax color. Yeah, yeah, yeah. ",
There's a better way because I had it to the point where it was showing me a bunch of different color formats you could choose from. I had to reinstall Eclipse because of Jen. ,
I had to reinstall this because it broke itself. ,
"That was painful having to go back through the video to make sure I did it right. It was awful. Where did Chris go? I see Sarah, I see David, I see the teacher. Where did Chris go?",
"No, he's still here. He's back there. He's just sitting. ",
"Oh, his back is to us. That's why. ",
Carefully. ,
"Son of a, son of a, sailor? Jimmy Buffet. ",
That's not bad at all. ,
No. ,
It that what you want? Sum plus or minus N?,
"Then it prints out the result. This was two weeks ago lab, part four. ",
Dude. I save them all. I just ... It wasn't last week. It must have been the week before. ,
"Okay, but this is only a single aray. Not a 2D aray. ",
So you have to adapt it. ,
What is this?,
"I was like, ""Can I have your vape?""",
Dumb ass. No I knew he was a dumb ass. ,
Like the energizer bunny. Eventually does need a recharge. ,
White rice or brown rice?,
"It's true, yes. But ...",
"Please continue, you've got two more. You've got Max an Emily. ",
We're easy targets. ,
Oh. How am I the easiest?,
I think I ruined curry for you. ,
It's bullshit. ,
Can you stop making sense? Wait a minute. ,
"Dudes. Close the door we can't hear. Oh my God, it's due in four minutes. ",
The class is over. ,
"I think Chris is going to love what I have. I'm just going to turn it in, see what he does. ",
The Ashley as spoken. You failed. ,
"She's doing well. You want to continue choking on your words? Oh I realized when I started. I was like, ""Oh this is going to sound terrible.""",
It's been uploaded. ,
"What, your laptop?",
Because you took a fall. ,
Dude. There's a lot more in here than I have on my assignment. I'm switching to this. Assignment for skeleton. There's a lot more on it than what I have on mine. Swap them out. ,
Can you take this from us?,
