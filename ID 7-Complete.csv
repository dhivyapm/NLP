"I recently found out [crosstalk 00:00:20] Okay, that's how it works. All right. [crosstalk 00:00:20]. I'm getting there. "
How come it's not letting me make a square like you? [crosstalk 00:03:08].
Hello? [crosstalk 00:10:15].
No really. I'm trying [crosstalk 00:10:18] even trying to use [crosstalk 00:10:20] with it.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
That's a method.
"This type of rectangle's gonna read that, it's gonna go to that, right?"
Okay.
Oh okay.
"[crosstalk 00:11:42] use a [crosstalk 00:11:44], man. Would I just ..."
Is it easier to use a switch than use a [crosstalk 00:12:16]-
Can I use it for [crosstalk 00:12:29]?
Is all this in the main?
Yeah. Why is [inaudible 00:16:42] [crosstalk 00:16:42] like this method?
Okay.
Okay.
"Oh, okay."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
You have to decode this scanner for each one [crosstalk 00:18:27]?
Instead of-
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). You just choose whatever you choose right here, and then it just goes to that, and-"
You just leave everything-
Mm-hmm (affirmative). [crosstalk 00:21:16].
Kind of like organize them better?
Mm-hmm (affirmative). [crosstalk 00:21:45].
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:22:00]. Sometimes it's just mainly used to organize [crosstalk 
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Yeah. Yeah. [crosstalk 00:22:40].
"Is it the right way though? The way [inaudible 00:28:27] actually? [crosstalk 00:28:29]. For that, the spatial code, did the [Packer 00:28:59] dude give it to you?"
Do you know it?
Okay.
"Okay. It's the same loop right? From packet 2? 'Cause I clicked on it, and it looks like the "
"Yeah. So, why is it two different dates? Why is it one on the 12th and then one of the 15th, like tomorrow? Because I did the whole thing, but I was I supposed to do part of it?"
Yeah. Was I supposed to do-
"Oh, I printed it out."
Yeah. And then-
"I didn't hand it over yet. I have it in my bag, but ..."
"Okay. 'Cause this is for packet 2, and packet 1 ... I thought it was two different things. 'Cause there's special reason packet 1, and then there's this one."
Yeah.
But isn't it all this? These are all the-
Okay.
"All eight, right?"
All eight?
"Okay. Well, can I just bring in the-"
Okay.
Alright. Was the second one easier?
Oh okay.
You can go.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Really? How do you get it to [inaudible 00:32:23]? It's not-
"Okay, so [inaudible 00:32:44] square [inaudible 00:32:59]."
I hope so.
You don't like your method's methods?
Both. Everything.
Solid.
All that work [inaudible 00:35:16].
Why am I starting off with [inaudible 00:35:40]?
I don't know.
[inaudible 00:37:31] just clip it on to-
You can wrap it around your neck or something.
There you go.
No.
What the hell?
That's crazy.
I think this is a trick question.
I know.
Oh my goodness. What the fuck?
Oh. Goddammit.
No. I can't afford to take a zero.
You could.
Damn. Is it? That's terrible.
I think it's argument.
Thank God I switched it.
What?
"That's crazy, man."
"She didn't like the first one, somehow."
Why is it giving me this error?
"Question. So, are we asking them to enter a string in the main method, and then making the next method and then just [inaudible 01:17:45] the input from there?"
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Okay. And then we're running the loop in the next method?
"Oh, okay."
Me neither.
That's crazy.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Yeah.
"Aaron, dude, I'm going to have to figure this out later."
"Yeah, I got some help. I'm going to have to hop on Google or something."
"I'll see you, man."
Too bad I haven't even ...
I'm just going to hand it to him.
"Alright. Catch you later, man."
Seven.
That's crazy.
What kind of vehicles are those? 
That's crazy. Damn. 
I see.
"The music, the soundtrack, caught me off guard."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, I just [inaudible 01:42:26]."
"It was like, array, dot and length?"
How old are you now?
"It is a long ass time, man."
You had the mic on.
What?
[inaudible 01:46:48]
Don't tell me you forgot already.
[inaudible 01:48:12]
That's what I did and it went away.
Yep.
It didn't work?
Uh-huh.
Is it then gonna be zero to nine.
Is it just one less?
"Was it displaying your random, maybe?"
[inaudible 01:54:10] between zero and nine. The next [inaudible 01:54:14].
All right. Are you gettin' this? Here.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Whatever term it's at?
Huh.
Alright I need to double this.
The ... In the ...
Is this all in the same multiple?
Did you make yours all in the same method?
The average ... 
Making ... the new array with the average.
Uh-huh (affirmative).
"Basically, what you do is you calculate the average by doing a length. That one's not really the end of the world."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Are they the same array?
"You make two different arrays. 'Cause you want a way to calculate the average, and then the next step ... So you don't have to make a new array to calculate the average, but the next step is transfer the values that are higher than the average into a new array. "
For D right?
"Using like A, B and ... I mean, the same array for A, B, and C?"
Yeah. But I'm just trying to get an average-
And divided by the length?
"So for D, you made a new array? That's why you made array two?"
Easier to read?
"Oh snap, I'm about to miss my ride."
"Please. I mean, I understand some, most of it ..."
Yeah. Do you want me to bring this to you?
Would you want me to bring this to you?
"I don't imagine [inaudible 02:19:33]. Like they said next week, we're doing this [inaudible 02:19:44] image."
[inaudible 02:19:44]. And the very first trail they get [inaudible 02:19:47].
"The one with all the weird [inaudible 02:19:49]. The models, 3D models and stuff."
"Yeah. Got to be good. All right, I'll see you tomorrow."
"All right, keep [inaudible 02:19:54]."

"Seven. You want to maybe put them in your backpack, or whatever, so."
What'd she say?
[crosstalk 00:00:28].
What if the sting [inaudible 00:01:07] to the string also?
[inaudible 00:01:14] seven and eight are like-
If you look at the middle option they're hovering over right now.
All right. Scroll up.
What's mystery method?
"So, I see two mystery methods. What's mystery method?"
But which one is the [crosstalk 00:02:58] mystery method?
Did that.
Should've [crosstalk 00:03:26].
Do you want Thomas to turn off the light?
I didn't want to say whether or not [crosstalk 00:03:56].
All the question?
Why do I find all the errors in this? I find like every single one.
"I know, right?"
The worst type?
That's convenient.
[crosstalk 00:09:20] or something?
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Mm.
What?
"One, two, three."
You said you're missing lot of code?
That's what I put.
What are you doing? This [crosstalk 00:14:20].
I'm so used to it so I [inaudible 00:15:27].
[crosstalk 00:23:08] five and fourths. [crosstalk 00:23:13].
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Seven 
"So, we have some low positive."
For ...
It shows it on the page 291.
"Yeah, number two shows initializing at random values. Then they put the risk for the loop for the row of columns."
Yes. 
I like you all value efficiency. Mr.
That should tag the linear.
What the hell?
What the heck?
It's like what ... No.
"Yeah, pretty much. "
Seven ...
Maybe.
[inaudible 00:05:07].
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
What are you trying to do? The ...
That won't even print. It's running even when you print anything.
That's all I did too.
Oh.
So it's-
"Hey, what's [crosstalk 00:14:26]?"
I close in zero. [crosstalk 00:14:40]. This is [inaudible 00:14:52].
Really?
It's been really good. It makes it [crosstalk 00:15:14].
"So, when I break it down from the top [crosstalk 00:15:38]."
How come mine keeps [crosstalk 00:27:27]?
"Like zero, zero every time."
What the heck. Okay. Getting that for [crosstalk 00:28:44].
Okay.
And the same thing for the next one?
It's going to do like N.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
So-
Didn't we do nine?
"Between, oh, one and nine."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"So, one. Five minus one. Eight plus one. Nine."
Inside the loop?
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Oops.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"So, it's going to figure out ... Why is it still printing zero?"
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Should I get rid of ... Does that matter? I did put the ...
This is making the array random.
It won't fill it.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
This one?
Right here?
Why's this printing zeroes? It's making array but it won't fill it.
Because he has pretty much the same thing as ... He's just filling.
Does he have two things here?
"What is this? He just picked random. Random algorithm. Eight? Oh, one to nine."
I think it's one.
That's another way to generate random numbers.
[inaudible 00:39:28].
checking it from [inaudible 00:41:53].
And you got to change that to a nine. Cut it off where?
She won't hook you up.
[crosstalk 00:45:10] coming in.
Should interest come in 2D array? Then they say you did that and you say in class 2D arrays.
Hopefully this [inaudible 00:46:34] will [inaudible 00:46:36] them.
I'll press a button. 
I know. It's going to be a long night.
What were you doing at 5:00 AM?
You still got to [inaudible 00:46:58].
Seven.
How are you doin' it?
Seem to be working pretty hard
"At the, at the "
Can't even hear me. 
Why?
"If it works, I don't see the problem. "
"Oh yeah, that is crazy. "
"So, are you asking for the user input in the second method?"
"Oh, so you did it, you just had the main method as one."
"So, are you taking the user input in the for loop? In the "
Okay.
ASCII? I have no clue. 
You just tryin' to do it a different way or something? 
Next line.
Output is giving me this error saying can't covert into boolean. 
"Yeah, you were saying what?"
"Yeah, I had row right there. "
Rows less than. Oh okay. Okay. Thank you. 
When did A start at 97? 
Shit.
"So, after you take the user input, do you have to create a separate for loop for the sum of the elements and getting the average?"
In a separate method?
Pretty much everything you know? I'm just not understanding how 
"So, you have the main method. You did that with one line to get "
"So, we're gonna just take the input at first from there "
"Okay, yeah. "
"So, you don't have to fill that with int a. "
"Oh, okay."
"So, this passing that to that?"
I thought they were doing that right here. That's why I'm confused  
Okay.
"So, I'm returning that to the main?"
Okay.
"But, what array is it using? Is it just using a random thing? "
"So, you add to the array."
"Oh, so we use that one."
Which is that.
Okay.
You can like plug that one 
Okay. 
Appreciate it. I'm just gonna do that.
"Yeah, gettin it. "
"Yeah, that helped for sure."
Alright. Tomorrow morning. 
Okay.
It's cool.
"Yeah, he was gone."
