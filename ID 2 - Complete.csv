Does it matter where it goes?
All right. Because I was going to say just put it ...
Yeah.
All right. Is that good?
Extra desk [crosstalk 00:00:27] every time.
They're listening to everything we say.
"Basically, yeah."
Why aren't [inaudible 00:01:11].
It's going to be a whole bunch of me just talking to myself.
"From I just read out what I'm doing. Like randomly, so."
"Oh, yeah. If not you can't use a switch."
A switch.
"But, I mean, if it's more."
I'll do it with this.
Yeah.
"Yeah. I've started always doing, like when we have these, I'll put a while in there that says like make input a valid thing. And like that's a good thought but it's the same thing, I'm the one doing it-"
"So, I'm not going to intentionally mess up."
And then ...
"Oh, this [inaudible 00:08:18]."
"We should've had a little intro. Don't listen to this. If nothing, it's just static."
What was the ... What was she saying [crosstalk 00:14:14].
I want these strings.
"I don't know. We have to enter the name of the shape. I was just doing like one is square, two is that kind of thing."
Is that a thing?
What are you doing for your end statements? I'm just drawing a blank on like all of the string thing that aren't in [inaudible 00:19:12].
Yeah.
And then you call them that.
Yeah.
"So, you're using-"
[crosstalk 00:19:43]?
For this string the F statement-
Okay. And you don't have to do it because it's ignoring the case. You can add like whatever [inaudible 00:20:06].
"Oh, that should be that one."
What?
"Oh, yeah. They all have to be double."
Yeah.
"I, yeah, I did them all as ifs at first too."
What?
Boom.
Yeah.
2spepci. 
What?
"No, I'm going to slam it. I'm going to hit the table probably. "
"No, no, no. I can give you more cord. "
You sure?
The only thing with that though is you can't verify. 
If they put something not in the range that it's asking for. 
"Yeah, yeah."
"Oh, there is?"
"Oh, I didn't know that. "
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). For the homework, I did 3.1415926 or something. I just did a bunch of decimals because I didn't think they wanted more specific than that. "
"But then I formatted it, so I did print and I made it two decimals. "
Yeah. 
It's math random times the... 
Times 10?
Or is it times nine plus one? 
"Right, so nine minus zero is nine."
"Yeah, but I think the plus one gets added after it, right?"
"[crosstalk 00:07:01] min plus one, or nine minus min, plus min?"
Okay. 
And then it's [crosstalk 00:07:10]. It's weird. There's another way-
I'll try. 
That's easy. 
What?
"The min is zero, yeah. But is it like-"
"This, yeah."
"Hey, we can fill in here if you want to... Oh, but we're attached. Hey, we're moving left Chris. We're shuffling. Get ready. "
Just to fill in this gap a little bit. Just make sure you're close enough. That way I don't throw the recorder. 
Okay. 
Cool.
"Oh, wait. I just got it. It's math random times upper, minus lower, plus one, plus lower. So it's upper minus lower, times math random. Then after that, add one. Then after that, you add in this case, zero. "
Yeah.
I always have to look up how to do math random. 
"Yeah, I was doing that before, but a bunch of the homeworks and stuff said, ""Do math random."" "
"Oh, okay. "
"I used to be like that and I was like, ""That's terrible."" "
Pseudo random?
Oh. 
Uh huh. 
"I mean, you could try it. [crosstalk 00:13:28] "
"All right, was it-"
You do for it and just keep counting because of it. You have to copy. You don't have to do... I don't know what the pseudo random thing is you were talking about. 
If you make a new random and then you do just random dot next-
And it starts at zero. 
"Right, so you have to do ten. "
"Yeah, right. "
Make the size of the loop bigger?
So you make the loop like I++N. 
"Yeah, but then in the loop, are you talking about in the loop? Make it source and then in brackets, I. "
"Source, like the array."
The brackets. Put the I in the brackets. 
That was Wednesday. 
"Yeah, I can do that. "
"Last time we sat around and studied for like, 30 minutes and then-"
"Yeah, for the next four hours we just did random shit. "
"Yeah, just from the book. Straight from the book. "
And because a lot of the stuff in the book-
"Yeah, yeah. "
"Yeah, but we probably started about like, two. "
All right. 
"What? Yeah, I mean we're hooked to our... I literally have like, after one I have that whole day, so. "
"I mean, we could split it. "
We don't all have to be there. Like we did last time. 
"We could do like, after 2600 like we did for-"
"Yeah, yeah. "
"Yeah, and I can do both and split half of it. "
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"Wait, what?"
No. 
"One of the things in the book, it says you have to specifically go through every single thing-"
Yeah. I'm pretty sure. 
"You have to loop and say print zero, print one, print two, print three. "
What?
So it says find the max value of array.
"Is that like, what does it mean ""find the max value""?"
"Yeah, so but you have to four loop that, right? "
"Yeah, no. You don't have to. "
What?
You have to four loop it and say-
"Yeah, you display source dot I, or not-"
"Yeah, and then not dot I. Source and then in brackets I. "
"Yeah. I did this C so quick, but I still don't get how to do B. I mean, I know what we're supposed to do, but I don't know how to go about actually doing it. "
"What if all the numbers randomize at zero, though?"
No. 
Yeah. 
It has to be great than or equal to. Because it's equal to and you set it to... it's still the same thing. 
"Is that still in the same four loop, though? Is that all in one loop?"
Okay. [crosstalk 00:32:05] If check equals plus nine. If check random.
"I was going to say, like where could-"
"Yeah, how big was the piece of bread? Like, just a-"
"Yeah. Not at once, hopefully, but-"
Oh my God. 
Fold it. You could fold it. 
One piece of bread?
In 30 seconds. 
"Dude, if I had bread for some reason in my bag, I would try right now. "
I got to prove that. That's exactly what we just said. 
That's bread. 
Ducks can beat everybody. 
Time me. Click. 
"Dang it, not better than the time I have to beat. Oh, gosh. Four... two count, four, zero. "
"What? Let's see. [crosstalk 00:35:40] Oh, oh. "
They just left.
"Nah, I doubt they finished. They just probably-"
"I'm on D. I haven't done anything with D, but I just finished C. "
D. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I literally skipped to C and she told me how to do B. She told me how to do B. I didn't know how to do it. 
"I mean, it looks like it would, right?"
I stole your truck variable. [crosstalk 00:38:10] 
"That's always been, he's like, ""This is probably going to cause problems."""
Sum divided by size. 
"That is a silly question. No, I'm just kidding. [crosstalk 00:39:07] "
B?
So that's the one-
"Yeah. You just keep it like... I don't know. You take like you have a variable, right? That checks that the element of the array that you're at, so as it's going, right? "
What?
"No, no. Because part A is like you're randomizing. This is saying like-"
"Yeah, yeah. Then you take that. You have a highest value variable-"
What?
"No, you want to start the max at zero. "
"Because that's like... Then basically in the four loop, you're checking if the value is bigger than that. If it is, then you set the max to that bigger value."
"Yeah, but it might not always be nine. [crosstalk 00:42:43] Right, exactly. "
"If the average, the total... "
"Oh, shit. Do you need that? "
I don't think I have to do that. 
"Oh, no the index is just going to be like, I. So we just put-"
"Yeah, the max. "
Yeah. 
"Wait, what? Say that again, sorry."
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Right. 
"Right, so you just... Yeah. "
"Yeah, but you only want to do it once when you get the max value. Once you've hit the cap. You want it to be like the first time. "
Then I guess you print the first one because you don't want to print all them. 
"Wait, did she say to print that?"
"I was just planning on printing out the first one, but I didn't know we had to print out all of them. "
Yeah. 
"Yeah, once you get the max you go back through and check every time it's equal to it."
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:46:05] 
"Tomorrow? When? Oh, I don't know. Probably tomorrow night because tomorrow we're going through all the-"
"Oh, oh. I don't know, it probably is by the start, but they're going to change it. [crosstalk 00:47:22] "
"Oh, no. Yeah, I just used literally the same one. "
"Yeah. No, I'm not. I dint finish it. "
I did not. It's 8:15. 
I'm waiting. 
"Oh, no. Plastic."
Two ...
Yeah.
What teams are y'all on?
Hey.
"Yeah, I'm on red."
"Red. Yeah. It's an easy choice, come on, Chris."
Searching is the processing.
"Wait, what?"
Searching.
Searching?
Wow.
What?
Two?
I think I got ... [crosstalk 00:03:13]
"Wait, which one are you on? [crosstalk 00:03:25]"
I can't even see it.
No. Like.
I just forget it.
We'll do that later. [crosstalk 00:04:23]
I cannot conclude. [crosstalk 00:04:55] What?
"No, the number."
I'm on eight right now.
What? It's one.
"No, it's one."
It's looking for six. It's not looking at the six index. It's looking for the index of sixe.
"For eight. Like, when it's the method. Well, that was what they were talking about. [crosstalk 00:06:19] What?"
"So, it's looking for eight in the red."
What question?
"Hang on. Yeah, so what are they-"
Chris went and picked it up.
"He was like, he said it was like recording like two hours or something."
But it wasn't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Thirteen, fourteen. You have a film for me? I left the music."
Your help is top-rated. [crosstalk 00:10:14]
"No, we're good. [crosstalk 00:10:23]"
What's up with ten?
[inaudible 00:11:15] for ten? [inaudible 00:11:15] [crosstalk 00:11:20] There's no six here.
Let's see our method like this. [crosstalk 00:11:49]
That's weird.
"I wonder how sensitive the mics are. Like, every time they look at ours, they just hear y'all, and they look at yours and they hear ours."
Isn't linear search-
"I don't get why it would be binary and not linear search. [crosstalk 00:14:14] Yeah, but I mean, if the ray is ... Like, I know if the ray is like 10,000 things long. But like, are y'all planning on making a ray that big?"
Hang on. I don't even know what the ...
What are you talking about?
"Yeah, me neither. Wait, start again. Adobe what?"
"Oh wait, that's weird. That should be free."
"No, Adobe reader is free, dude."
"What is twelve? You have the book. You're past twelve, right?"
What is twelve?
"Lower, I mean, above thirteen."
And then what's thirteen?
Was this bubble sort?
I thought selection sort was the host one where it kept going from the top.
"Yeah, see, again, I feel like the selection sort is so much easier."
But like-
"[inaudible 00:17:44] selection sort, it's so much easier to like ... It's so much cleaner looking."
"Oh, my bad [inaudible 00:18:08]. [crosstalk 00:18:10]"
Oh god. [crosstalk 00:18:30]
"So, is fourteen bubble then?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, but so is this."
Okay.
What question is that?
Thirteen? [crosstalk 00:20:06] It's multiple and then neighboring. It's on page 884 apparently.
Wait 864?
Nice.
Eight. [crosstalk 00:21:05]
"The bubble sort. [crosstalk 00:21:31] So, sixteen is selection? If the other one ... If fourteen is bubble, is sixteen selection?"
That's the other-
Did you do this one?
"Oh, okay."
Uh-oh.
We're good? [crosstalk 00:22:39]
I don't get any of this. [crosstalk 00:24:34]
Oh. [crosstalk 00:25:07]
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, go back."
I don't ...
I think ... I guess ... But that's just-
Sort.
You're lucky you don't have the restraining orders.
"Okay, so. [crosstalk 00:27:20] Get a restraining order again to you?"
"Dude, this is 2019. Why are we ..."
No.
[inaudible 00:29:38] sort automatically.
He's like breaking his voice. [crosstalk 00:29:51] Yeah. I want to get like the sound files and sync them up together and just listen back to them.
How awful that would be. 
Sixteen? [crosstalk 00:30:18] Selection.
"What? Selection? That was one of the ones that she did up here. That was the first one that she did. No, today. She did selection and then bubble, which is this one."
"Yeah, she did this twice, but it was different. This code, the code didn't change, but she did selection on the board manually."
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:31:13]
"Yeah. Yeah, that's why I was confused. I don't know. Did you do fifteen?"
I'm talking to my partner right here. I've got a grader on the exit form.
"Oh, I see. So, wait, this is identical?"
Yeah. This one's just first.
"Because it's supposed to ... So, like three, five, two."
Yeah.
[inaudible 00:33:49] You know [inaudible 00:33:50] how he had to move? Have you seen Mikey?
He's my favorite. He's so excited to be here. 
Mikey's my favorite.
[inaudible 00:34:13] Just kidding.
"[inaudible 00:35:45] two types of technically? Okay, so for this one. This one should be three, five, two. So, shouldn't this be three, two, five?"
"If it's three, five, two, then it-"
"And then it goes to two, three, five? I don't get how the order is."
"Like, if the first ones switch, does it do the first ones again? That's my question. So, it's three, five, two. Now does it do ..."
"Okay, so if this is ... My question. If this is three, five, two, right?"
"Two, five, three?"
"So, this line is right, then?"
Yeah.
So then two should be just this again? Oh Jesus. Like that. It should literally just be like that? That would be the technical first term.
"So, it would switch eight and six? Or eight and seven?"
That's what I-
"Two, three, five."
Yeah. I know what the last one's supposed to be.
[inaudible 00:40:34]
What?
"Um, we're not doing."
Don't move it. That's not going to do anything.
"So, it's ..."
Right.
Which one are you on?
"So, did you get the right order for on number four then?"
"Okay, that's what I ... Because that makes it-"
That's what I wanted to make sure. [inaudible 00:43:46] already breaking.
Out of what?
"Yeah, what did you get wrong? And does it tell you the right answer? Asking for a friend."
What number is that? Eight?
"Number eight is negative one because it's not one because this isn't sorted. It's using binary switch, and it's not sorted."
"Because the one above it, you tell it that it's using binary switch."
What did you put?
Yeah.
Have you seen my [inaudible 00:45:35].
Yeah.
What [crosstalk 00:45:47]
"It was all Chris' fault, I promise."
[crosstalk 00:46:00] fault.
Wrong? Huh? The whole thing?
"What? Wait, what?"
"How come every time you sit in the chair, it screams at you? [crosstalk 00:46:36]"
What is it?
"Yeah, is that still recording?"
Two.
Trying not to drop it this time. 
Were you able to figure something out? [crosstalk 00:03:40]
What? [crosstalk 00:03:45]. Yeah. I'm always having something for [inaudible 00:03:49].
[crosstalk 00:03:51]
"Dude, that's kind of. "
[crosstalk 00:04:03]
[inaudible 00:05:07]
What? What for loop?
"Okay, so is a asking to put each array give it another array?"
The arrays in the array? 
"With other random numbers? Or, something else? "
"Okay, so you make an array. You're make one array. "
And just so you know [crosstalk 00:07:06].
"Okay, so are you doing it when you define the array? "
"When you make the array, are you using two bracket sets?"
And each of those is a random number?
"It's the coordinates, even when you initialize it?"
Okay. 
"How did you, sorry. How did you initialize it?"
Oh. [crosstalk 00:08:57]
Point the array [crosstalk 00:09:32].
"Okay, so you're making the 2D arrays that's minimum 2x2, maximum 9x9, because it's random, right? [crosstalk 00:09:58]. Then, you're filling each of those elements with a random number from 1-9. "
"Yeah, but it's saying fill the array, so you have to fill it first. [crosstalk 00:10:21]"
"Well, I could show a for loop through it, and be like bam."
"So, how do you get the length of one [crosstalk 00:11:04]."
"But, that's like the columns."
"So, then it'll go sideways? "
Okay. Why don't you just use a second for loop?
"Then, what's the count? "
"Yeah, that's what I had. "
Because you're bad [inaudible 00:12:25]
"Wait, cannot invert length. Oh."
"Yes, if you input the random class, or whatever,[crosstalk 00:12:59]"
It is.
"I asked David how to do it, and he said just do that one. It's so much easier, and it is. That's what I've been using. "
Now I'm crying a little.
"So, like [crosstalk 00:13:18]"
"Random name. It's New.Random(). Then, to call it you do the Random.nextInt()."
"Then, you have to do the little formula. [crosstalk 00:13:27]"
2
[crosstalk 00:13:27]
"3,4,5,6,7,8,9."
"1,2,3,4,5,6. [crosstalk 00:14:31]"
"Yeah. Cause it starts at 0, that's the weird thing, you have to count, you take the difference +1. "
What?
"I'm glad you got it, cause I didn't understand it."
I'm here. Hold on. Can you see it now?
Really?
"Now, I don't know if that works."
"Oh, yeah. I don't know.[crosstalk 00:18:25]"
"I ran mine in the first thing it did it, it's like a 6x6, and I'm like [crosstalk 00:19:00]. Then, I ran it again, and it said normal. "
I just got really lucky.[crosstalk 00:19:04]
Calculate the average of numbers in each column.[crosstalk 00:19:23]
Print the average.[crosstalk 00:19:39]
J. 
Calculate the average of numbers.[crosstalk 00:20:15]
"Ow. Thank you, Dan.[crosstalk 00:20:50]"
Calculate the average of numbers in each column. [crosstalk 00:21:07]
"Don't use Math.random(), use the other one. "
[crosstalk 00:21:28].
Okay. [crosstalk 00:21:29]
"So, i and j. Is i the column or is j the column? [crosstalk 00:21:48]"
"So, how do you add the columns together?"
How do you add the columns together? [crosstalk 00:22:07]
[crosstalk 00:22:54]. In the j loop? That won't work. Cause it's still gonna run through j as many times as the arrays [crosstalk 00:23:01]
"Oh, like the outer loop is the [crosstalk 00:23:09]"
I think I know it. [crosstalk 00:23:31]. I just have to like [crosstalk 00:23:32]
That's deep.[crosstalk 00:23:52]
Oh.
What? [crosstalk 00:26:29]
Where?
Where? What [inaudible 00:26:42]? 
I want coordinates.
"But, are you actually [crosstalk 00:26:54]"
What? 
"To be fair, Pokemon is better. "
What?
"No, my [crosstalk 00:27:25]. My header is literally like [inaudible 00:27:28]. Then, the description is just activity 20. [crosstalk 00:27:30]"
"I put it just because, that I'm like 99% sure we don't need it. "
"Holy shit. I did it first try. I can't believe it. I just did what you said to do. So, I mean you get all the credit. [crosstalk 00:29:09]"
[crosstalk 00:29:20]
"Hey, Nazarene, put Angie in our group."
Please. 
"Oh, oops."
[inaudible 00:32:36]
[crosstalk 00:32:38]
What?
The main one? 
"It randomly, you have to make it randomly think 2-9, both length and [crosstalk 00:33:20]"
"Yeah, both of them are, it's either the minimum it can be is 2x2, and the max it can be is 9x9. But, it can be anything [crosstalk 00:34:25]"
"Yeah, it can be like 2x3, or 7x2."
[crosstalk 00:34:29]
"Oh, wait the average of this isn't divided by 2, it's divided by [crosstalk 00:35:27]"
"1,2,3,4.[crosstalk 00:36:43]"
[crosstalk 00:37:27]
"How do we do the thing where we go through and search the, I'm on the last step, but the one where the sort. How do you sort them? "
Yeah. Like smallest to largest. 
[inaudible 00:38:27] like selection sort. I think that would work [crosstalk 00:38:32]
"At the end. It says, find the max average. Then, the way I'm doing it is I'm putting each of the averages into array, like we did in lab for the deck of cards. "
"Yeah, how do I do that?"
"It's one for loop, right?"
"Yeah. If average array of i > x, then next = integer array of i. [crosstalk 00:39:56]"
"Yeah, okay. That works. [crosstalk 00:41:32]"
"Oh shit. You know what I just realized? On the exit forum, we're supposed to check all of he prime for these. I've only been reading the top one. Because, I thought it was like the top one was the best, and the bottom one was the worst. It was one of those rate your [crosstalk 00:43:02]. So, I've only been doing this one [crosstalk 00:43:04]."
"Yeah. But, I'm evaluating you. [crosstalk 00:43:17]. So, in my other ones, you have not been responding, or valuing, or organizing. "
"Well, at least you're on recording saying that. [crosstalk 00:43:31]. So, hopefully, you do take that into account."
"No, I just used one array for the average, and then the main array. I only have two arrays. You know that deck of cards thing we did? It's kind of like that, where you have a parallelogram. "
"Oh, Brandon."
"Oh, nevermind. [crosstalk 00:44:07] "
What's up? 
"Yeah, I know. [crosstalk 00:44:18]"
"Yeah, I just had the average array that was the same size as the, like how many columns there were. [crosstalk 00:44:27]"
"[crosstalk 00:44:27]. Then, I just assigned each average to, I just went through the averages; assigned each one to the array. It took the biggest one. "
Am I good if I close this?
"I mean, I already did, but [crosstalk 00:44:33]."
"Oh, shit. That would be me."
[inaudible 00:49:38]
[crosstalk 00:49:42]
[crosstalk 00:51:50]
David. David. Can you [crosstalk 00:52:34]
Two
That is the third dimension.
"Yeah, so there is one, two and then three."
Have you done the quiz that is due tomorrow morning?
Yeah
What is the length.
That is what I put.
There is a billion other [inaudible 00:01:27]
"Ruth, what's up?"
[crosstalk 00:01:40]
"Now wait, two dimensional, that is the squared one, right? That is rows and columns?"
Yeah 
[crosstalk 00:03:15]
"Look at this, I have been working on assignment three."
How do we return in array?
How do we return in array?
"No, not display, return it out of the method."
Yeah
"No, it says ..."
No
Yeah?
Define the method that calculates the average ... [crosstalk 00:10:07]
How do I get the length of the second [inaudible 00:03:11]
Okay.
Thank you.
Man I just did the quiz too.
"Yeah. I live through this class, and I am tired and then we get to the lab in the morning, and I am tired again."
Yeah
For 12:13?
"Yeah, for missing all these other classes."
Nah
"Yeah, okay, whatever you say."
No I have not.
"Is that an offer? No, I am just kidding."
"Yes, the answer is yes."
"I have a question for you, while on the topic of attendance. I know I missed a lab, but it does not say I missed a lab."
"Oh, okay so do you have that I missed a lab?"
Okay
Okay
Okay
"And it is if you miss more than two, or if I miss one more I am screwed?"
Okay
"Because I am not planning on missing lab, but ..."
Okay
"Okay.  Cool.  You change that, no I am just kidding."
"But what a goofy though, he just walked away."
You have two bracket sets.
"Yeah, the first size is the first bracket, the second size is the second bracket."
You have to have two inputs.
Yeah
"Dude I woke up this morning and this dude had messaged me at six in the morning, just him playing league."
Was that really since last night?
Oh my god.
"[inaudible 00:20:38] for 2600 yesterday. They talked about getting help if you have an addiction, and you were like, we are going to send you there."
Define a method that could ... 
Mm-hmm (affirmative)-he has it.
"He has it, where you can look."
"He has it, where you can see how much he has played."
Yeah
What?
May I ask a question?
[inaudible 00:24:55]
Why?
Is that not what we have been using for the longest time?
But it is not a [inaudible 00:25:41]
"Oh okay, yeah. So do you just put them inside? It does not make a difference right?"
[inaudible 00:25:52]
What?
Who knows.
It is their loss.
Yeah
"Yeah, it is not like the one we had to do each ..."
It is all of them.
Okay you do not have the return [inaudible 00:26:41] right?
It is not [inaudible 00:26:48]
I just threatened [inaudible 00:26:56]
Is it not the same thing?
This?
Hmm. Okay so it is the right way of doing it.
Is it this?
How do we convert a number to a character?
Character.
"No, it says you have to randomly generate a character, right?"
So I was doing it with numbers.
But I want to turn that number into a character.
"Oh wait, hang on."
"Wait, what? Why is that not working?"
"Nevermind the [inaudible 00:29:36] is doing its work, I was just being dumb. I did not have it in parenthesis. You can later do the type casting thing."
You can just sort of [inaudible 00:29:48] and then the number.
[crosstalk 00:29:54]
I think it was Tuesday.
"All right, thanks."
"So there has been a second one. It says you have to do a search method for the character, and if you find it you have to return the index of the [inaudible 00:38:07] up there."
How do you return the index of a two dimensional array as one?
[inaudible 00:38:15] twice.
Uh-huh
"That is what I was thinking too, but like ..."
"Because it asks you to return the index and if it is two dimensions, you have to return two numbers. Right?"
"Right, yeah."
It wants you to return the [inaudible 00:39:26] character.
Okay
Okay
Okay
So it would just be like ...
Yeah
Yeah
"And you could straight up just say, I and J right? "
Like that?
Okay
Cool
Oh
I know. 
What you do? 
Why?
Why?
But you are taking the INT.
So then you basically just default these to negative one then?
"But if you do not find the character as the negative one, but ..."
Okay
Because it tells you to make it in the method.
"I mean, yeah."
"Skylar, normally you would."
Yeah
You better be sorry.
I am not David.
No you said you were going to ask David first.
[inaudible 00:50:34]
All right what?
Oh yes.
"Okay, you are trying to return the array right?"
"In where you have public static double, you have to put brackets after that double."
"Yeah, because you are returning the array, not the double."
Yeah
Yeah
That is what I tried to do.
You can use the exact same array.
I am pretty sure.
If I understand the question.
No I am not laughing at that.
Two.
You might have to extend the cord.
Wow.
Do I need to?
Oh.
Yeah. While... while recording
(laughs) Nice.
"Nice, is it still going?"
Okay. 
"I was gonna say, twelve twelve, research recordings in which I talk to other people and-"
(laughs)
"So yeah, this didn't work. What I did up there didn't work."
What?
Oh I know-
Uh-huh(affirmative)
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Wouldn't that mean instead of a variable? Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, I see what you're... yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you can do that, that works fine."
"Dude, the probability of you winning this thing is like, one out of like..."
"Like, I can't... I don't know if-"
I'm gonna actually like... if I have it right
'cause I'm still here and I'm just... it refuses to let me win.
(laughs)
"Wait, did she say... did she say how to get it?"
 How do you get it to do it when you hit enter?
"How do you get it to do it when you hit enter? Like I have it printing out just the whole thing, but up there it says like, when you print enter, it should print the next step."
Okay.
Okay.
"But that makes it even harder to translate 'cause like, now you can sit here and enter until you win. All right, imma just take this."
"No, what?"
"Yeah but you look over there, that's a whack-ass circle bro, look at... circles were after, hinges were after... this circle over refused dude."
The chances... oh my god.
"Yo this is how the lottery works, dude. It's just, you keep getting... yeah I have yet to win."
"I've been so close so many times. I'll get like, four to five."
That's true.
"Yeah but then I have to go back and change it, killing my work. I have to go back and change it. Yeah, but like..."
"No, still low."
"I'm gonna say, ""Congratulations, you won. Thank you for clicking 'Enter' millions of times""."
"Ha, good job."
(laughs)
(laughs) That's how I live my life.
"I'm so tired of seeing that I lost, dude."
Shiieeeeet.
"Wait, what?"
"Yeah, if like, ""if boolean"", and then ""if boolean is equal to true elsewhere"", then it'll run."
"It still works if you say like ""If boolean equal to true"", but you don't have to do this."
(laughs) Nice.
"Wait, what?"
Nah.
"Dude, that's a good question. Yeah, also it didn't work even when it was supposed to work, so that's why. Yeah."
I just rigged it and set like a whole row to... or like a whole column to one.
Yeah.
(laughs)
Ooh.
Okay. Sky.
Sky. I dig it. I dig it.
(laughs) yeah.
No. Start like rapping.
"(laughs) Yeah. Wait, what?"
(laughs) Yeah that end of the mic.
"Yo, Reed. Hurry. Dude, hurry up and do it, and then we can like, we can just like sit here and play League."
(laughs)
"I said hurry up and do it, and we can just sit here and play League. Just like (laughs)"
Yeah good. Do it.
[crosstalk 00:21:45]
Bruh. You- you...
"Yeah, you have to. It wasn't a suggestion. Like you can't play normal games unless they're a certain level. But they're real easy. You play like six of them. You can literally like all run down... Dude, we could literally run down like, one lane and like win it. Like, we could run down one lane and win it. Like for the bot games, they don't... they're awful."
There's literally no point to jungling in the bot games. You can tri-lane bot and-
"Yeah, yeah. They don't carry."
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're still drafting David.
"(laughs) Dude, you put it there Reed. Stupid."
"I love how you put the mic closer to you like, every single search."
(laughs)
"I did all kinds of work today, yes I did."
(laughs)
(Laughs)
Get on League. Exit from your game.
Do the exit form. Do the exit form. Do it. Ha-ha.
"(laughs) I don't think that's how that works, Reed."
"Yeah, yeah yeah."
(laughs)
"Yeah. It's kinda like, not like that."
"I mean like, the first half is, but then like, the... I don't..."
"Yeah, like the second half of like, checking it, that didn't work at all so..."
"I used like, a parallel array that said like, if the randomly generated number all five times is equal to itself, then we win. Does that make sense? Yeah. I don't think that's how you're supposed to do it. Yeah."
(laughs)
Wait there's not?
But the other...
"No, not..."
We're not talking about- we're talking about 2600.
"Go away, I'm just kidding."
(laughs) [inaudible 00:26:40]
"You wish you were in that class. Not really, you don't wanna be in that class."
"Whoa, all right, you know what? I'm leaving dude. Somebody get this microphone. "
"Bruh, I'll do that if you actually do the exit form and you play a game like right now. Like in here. Like, I swear to god. You have- the track pad. The track pad."
Does Angela have her... borrow Angela's if she has hers. What?
Yeah we're gonna play Normal. Dude we got like 30 minutes. Play something like really shitty. That you don't need... oh no 'cause you gotta move still.
"Yeah, yeah."
He's actually just mad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Dude, just, yeah turn it... you can turn it back on. I can write on em. I don't know how to do it on there. Y'all have... wait y'all have like the same laptop. What?"
"All right, I'm closing this, dude."
Play ARAM. Okay. 
I'm playing a bot game. Unless Brandon shows up.
"But that's even more of a role play line than if it's three. Unless we're up against bots, but like-"
"(laughs) Yeah. Dude, fucking Reed. We got a Karthus jungle in our game and like, as soon as it happened, he was like, ""Yo, send it to Brandon, show him. He needs to see""."
[crosstalk 00:28:59]
Well.
"Track pad. Track pad Fortnite, dude."
