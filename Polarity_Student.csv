i guess yeah sure yeah just say you do just need to make sure i dont get up really fast okay including what youre saying right now good thing we have a lot to say here thats fine and it said we were supposed to use f statements too right what we cant just use what i mean you probably could inaudible  at  oh what oh i at least want to code these as a farm like going to be given most to somebody else and theyre going to be a total dick about it and put  and i realized that im the person testing this and im not going to be doing that so theres no reason for me to do a double just in case yeah i let my girlfriend test a thing that i did i was like try it out and the first thing she did was write that she was like oh hmm man our commentary is so riveting like this length of silence is brought to you by dedication all right lets do that what  oh what yeah no thats why theyre using the f statement so that it can be shape equals ignore case or whatever mmhmm affirmative oh shit  can i  theyve already been initialized once so i cant mention that again oh for the f statement  so if a shape equals ignore case square just you clear the string instead of having to initialize it and then you prompt the user for the individual like things that it needs for these develop problems and then result equals yeah and then you just put the result and then initialize what yeah shape dot equals ignore case and then you can just put in quotations whatever name it is yeah because my default was to put an or statement to both of them but you dont have to with the ignore case and it looks like it is close to time let me go ahead and save this and start putting to dos in here okay lets see i dont know if thats correct formatting but we will see we will see oh we need to  oh wait no its going to need to be a double because probably its  yeah the result has to be a double it wasnt much of effects yeah okay and  i think i did it i feel like this is too easy wait every time i think that im doing things the right way im like why dont i get it its way too hard and im doing it wrong and then its easy im like im pretty sure im doing it wrong are we supposed to loop it no it didnt say loops eh its crosstalk  oh i didnt do the second part bummer oh no two so   do you need me to get closer here thats fine  should be good  yeah  cool cool cool  i have a question for the initializing the new arrays since were getting the user to define the size of the array can we when were doing the new ant  can we put new ant input next ant in the bracket its letting me do it but i dont know if thats proper  so i could just instead of creating new ant equals i and then putting new ant brackets i that seems like an extra step  just for the source size  yeah because were not going to use the source size for anything else so it should be okay just to be in there  yeah okay cool  cant verify oh you right you right i know there was something on i think it was the lab test that i was making a lot of values and stuff and then i was like i dont really need to do that i could just break that down like the formula for whatever that i was doing i could not use it it may have been the homework pi or something theres a math dot pi instead of mmhmm affirmative math dot pi in all caps  yeah thats how i got the correct number because i assigned it to  and it was rounded weird  yeah  yeah as long as it got  mine was like  or something after the decimal because i just did  so i did pi and that has itll calculate the shit ton of digits so  yeah okay right right right okay trying to figure out how to pace this crosstalk  those are four seven and then zero tag  i think its math dot random times  for it to be zero to nine  you could also well its the maximum minus the minimum plus one  in order its max minus min plus one so its max minus min plus one  for you to get exactly what youre well we can look it up on the api i think i think it tells you  its been a little bit to it was one the paragraphs that you yeah  cool please do  please add points to my test wait let me get in on this please add points to my test  we were just talking about that i think so crosstalk  no i think you were right  mmhmm affirmative  yeah so if we did want ten then thats what it would be it would be one minus ten minus one plus one or something like that hey nelson  not going to be able to use any of my stuff im not paying attention what am i doing okay  shuffling where god  sure sure  you know i had this okay no you know what i can just bring the preseven that i did  that sounds awful but okay what am i doing gosh equals math dot random yeah that should be capitalized  right oh the first math isnt supposed to be  oh okay crosstalk  class random crosstalk  yeah  yeah yeah youre wearing sandals yeah crosstalk  it checks out checks out  when it says pseudo random does that still count this says next in im looking at the methods for the random class  it says next in and you can specify the maximum value  it says return to pseudo random uniformly distributed ant value between zero inclusive and the specified value exclusive drawn from this random number generator sequence yeah i think it has to be attached to something  yeah uh huh yeah its close  yeah it does not include nine so youll have to go one up  yeah  where is your friend  talked about conspiracy theories  i tried to test by displaying everything  i dont think itll let me cost strain what i should be able to display them all if i call source right print line just print source it should display all of them right or no if im wanting to display all of the things in the array i can just type in source and display it right or no no thats why in order to display it you have to use a loop to display it dang okay were going to do this again four count equals zero  okay lets do this  eight nine eight two three four five six seven eight nine ten it does do ten it just printed out ten options for me  oh okay no nevermind im thinking about the wrong thing i typed in ten so it did print ten but i was still thinking about the nine limit wait  i keep looking back there instead of right here where the actual pdf is  uh huh  find which number out of the array the random numbers he assigned which is the highest we did it in another thing where you compare number to number and if thats higher you replace it and then you go to the next one  yeah i think its another four loop but its not telling us to do methods right we could do methods but i dont think this is supposed to be a looped program either so it doesnt really matter crosstalk  okay lets see crosstalk  okay crosstalk  source account it would help if i spelled things right crosstalk  nice sure sure sure the average maybe i will do do i feel like doing classes or methods because i kind of feel like doing methods this is going to be due tomorrow by  the panel has to go up so you have to create a four loop that is going through each of the individual numbers for your array  yeah so you attribute the number youre checking to the next integer or whatever so four int count equals zero and each loop youre going to increment it by one that way you go through each one and for each loop you do check equals the source count so whatever number is in that specific source count then if that number is higher than your current highest like you have another value that is called highest and i set that one to one which the lowest you can go is zero and if one is higher than zero so thats starting so if its higher than one well then one is going to be the highest  yeah i know i know its going to be an error  but you cant have like is zero higher than zero  thats true yeah and it did have two nines in there so i think itll still work no matter what so you can set it to zero i think  yes i only have one loop in this so the check and then an if condition if this is greater than the highest then you change what the highest is so the highest equals check then when you go around the next time youre changing what check is at the beginning  no no im not going to do this nevermind i was going to do methods but i think thats going to be a lot of wasted time crosstalk  take the average  thats true thats very true crosstalk   how big was the slice of bread aw crosstalk  i can dry swallow medication i bet i could dry swallow a piece of bread  all at once  the whole thing just roll it up  yeah you could crush it into a little ball it would be chewy  yeah its not that much yeah  oh i bet ill inaudible   hes mad because hes like that was our strategy crosstalk  thats bread  im going to go home and test this now  my moms going to be so confused go home like listen im just standing in the kitchen  im going to see if this even works nope oh  oh no i think the average is going to have a nested loop no is there not it doesnt okay nevermind i just have to add more things lets see  average values im so distracted  sum equals zero crosstalk  theyre just no  lets see average crosstalk   okay equals this is a silly question but is average sum divided by size or size divided by sum okay  this is worse crosstalk  ah ah ah crosstalk   what okay i have average now i need higher values  crosstalk   greater than crosstalk  shit maybe just crosstalk   so which one is it for d did you oh okay no it says it same type and size i was like did you create another size indicator i was trying to figure out how to do a loop to count and also assign it to a thing in the same it was going to be real weird i had to do two f ones are you done oh thats true yeah let me check account is youre good are you heading out or are you waiting well crosstalk  i told you i have very delicate hands  its very strong push it on stop yeah  one yeah okay that super sweat crosstalk  no i did not crosstalk  oh fancy pants oh were close to being five stars inaudible  came to be that totaled aisle yeah thatd be fine i dont really care i have like two or three extra yeah okay whats  what im on the blue one hes on red are you on yellow its whatever  before we  seven ten searching the rays what oh ill fill in the blank is the inaudible  blank is the process thats not on this page this is the process im looking searching ironically yeah  yeah it is not on  which is where the issue came about match the following definition to pair the key elements of inaudible  each element found or til the end of the ray is reached middle amp crosstalk  do you know question two yeah you got question two right yeah what is the form like um excuse me i have never inhaled crosstalk  i think inaudible s paranoia is getting to you well stop thats the whole point crosstalk  its not  crosstalk  oh my god  is it the number or the position its the irb method i love the inaudible  marked up theyre like whats the answer i love that you guys are locked up and youre like whats the answer give us the answer thats true they gave up oh okay im proud of you the string method crosstalk  we didnt touch it but we yeah  yeah he checked well we didnt touch it and we were here the whole time crosstalk  yeah yeah i dont inaudible  maybe it was on and sarah didnt know it and then she pressed record to start us but it was on before that yeah it might have not been turned off or it had accidentally been turned on before and maybe she pressed record thinking it was turning on and it turned off because he saw there was a recording of two hours or something so obviously it was on before us okay oh dang i just messed that one up crosstalk  well the point is all the searching methods are supposed to return the same thing barring the binary search error relatable inaudible  crosstalk  what sort of eight eight eight four what eight are we four blah why are we going to eight eight eight four it took us to one of the pages way in the back for bubble rays what this is not the right page maybe it is i dont know because this is an external sort not a bubble sort  point three yeah no thats the wrong page crosstalk  this papaya tastes perfect i said this papaya tastes perfect that this papaya tastes perfect thing back in high school we had a computer class where we had the mics and we had to use the like dictation stuff one of the test phrases so that you could make sure you werent getting too many errorrated feedbacks was this papaya tastes perfect terrible terrile the key is that it says that its already sorted and binary only works when its already sorted and its the fastest one to go through it linear search is if you cant use binary search you have to use  yeah binary would not work where is this yes i am right now bubble sort sort inaudible  what does it sort crosstalk  yeah i dont want to watch that video under the process of bubble sort  im at the process of bubble sort its very hard to reiterate but i know we still okay how loud is the feedback on these because i get like real close to the mic and everything yeah just dont do what i just did like every time i cough i lean right here crosstalk  is performing okay crosstalk  selection sort yes where is twelve smallest and first it is merit able and neighboring that one is selection sort yeah wait yes yeah the selection sort is it keeps switching the first one crosstalk  the bubble is the two right beside each other swap i used bubble sort for the next thing that it needed it wasnt too bad but i think bubble sort might have been quicker too i forget inaudible  need to keep track of values k and i zero swap one moment what crosstalk  okay k is going to be  four  wait fourteen fourteen i believe is the section sort because its swapping with a tempor  wait hold on yeah its depending on what  yeah no youre right its bubble sort because its the one above it does that have the thing to its  its at the very very bottom  yeah it was way different yeah its in the blue crosstalk  yeah yeah showing off crosstalk  three two crosstalk  that one is going to be crosstalk  sixteen is  yes because it has the current minimum thats yeah thatll inaudible  im working on fifteen im trying to figure out what the hell its doing i think if the  then thats the new minimum i think its doing selection i think okay two and zero crosstalk  two and what maybe its just  but its not doing neighbors is it maybe it is crosstalk  i dont understand what k and i are i keep thinking that its either bubble sort or selection sort but i cant really  im still on fifteen hey i need help with fifteen i keep thinking its bubble sort or selection sort but im messing up on the iterations because of this so what does that mean isnt that checking itself if k is  yeah because e is one and i is the count so thats both that right so crosstalk  it wouldnt move thats it crosstalk  yeah i dont know what its referring to because it  this is  this is talking about bubble sort and then thats some of it but that doesnt have the other things and then thats the only thing it mentions and its just like mystery method so yeah crosstalk  and it doesnt reference anything so how would i know to go all the way back up here if that was it yeah thats just random stuff and its  theres nothing referencing i dont know because it could technically be either one but the only thing we have for a clue right here is that these two are swapped that could be selection or bubble but i dont understand what these intervals mean but its crosstalk  oh so that finishes the outside so it is selection is that right yeah i dont think were using any of the other ones right now okay so this  so instead of these being comparable this would be one and then i plus one or whatever no but ive done bubble sort three two five eight yeah three crosstalk  yeah and then itll start back over for  yeah yeah okay so then it will go two three  five eight and then itll check in over there yeah and thats sorted okay crosstalk  that is very confusing yeah i had to go back and do the binary by hand i tell everyone feel bad crosstalk  the papayas taste great oh gosh i thought were supposed to have pattern recognition for the sorting and this zero iteration is wrong yeah its bubble sort so this is just the inner loop and this is the outer loop so this is going through and swapping the ones closest to and then it starts over and swaps the one thats out of place yeah and then the last one is just checking the one and two and the two and one are both just checking yeah yeah it is theres a typo on the last question too its supposed to be the  thats supposed to be five three  or its supposed to be three five two instead of two three five it has the current min index selection yeah but thats the initial start so  crosstalk  it goes through and checks if thats the lowest number that its encountered then if it isnt or if it is the new lowest it moves it to the front so it should move three to the front and then it should swap through with two so that should be  but its good for everybody else because those are identical oh yeah but if people dont understand this part either theyre going to be like what did it do on that turn whats the iteration its whatever you know as you do three five crosstalk  no because two and three swap five doesnt swap because five is in the second  oh yeah youre right yeah because they didnt notice that they didnt swap i dont know it checks for the minimum to see if everything is higher than the minimum and if its not then it puts whatever was lower in the first position and then the next loop it changes the index so its checking for second position second index and then it goes through and checks and makes sure everything is higher than that one then it goes through and checks every  like it goes all the way up in the index just to make sure that everything after this number is higher three five two so five three five two and then  no five would remain there because two is going to be swapped with three so then itll be five three two or itll be two five three yes because two and three will be swapped it does it in a really weird way so they dont mix things up more before it sorts everything out im confusing myself so five three two is the original and then three five two and then two five three so bubble  so theyre both wrong so number one should be two five three well its still checking five this iteration is making sure the thing after five is supposed to be there i dont know anymore i dont know im so confused now seven eight nine okay so that would be two five three two two is the new low so after one it would go through as normal so it should be two five three for one and then itll switch to the second  the first position first index this is  number one is wrong too because if this is where it starts its five three two and then those swap and its three five two and then two and three swap and then its two five three so its all wrong the whole start of the index is wrong were so boggled now yeah we got that one down its not using selection yeah yeah so this is the current minimum and then  yeah and put that in the first position hey sarah inaudible  it jumbles everything what how five three two eight seven nine six what oh yeah oh okay i see what youre doing now i thought it was something totally different i was so confused okay yeah okay so two and it swaps with whatever two is so three is correct five is correct so the next highest is six and it swaps with eight two three five shit three five six seven nine eight okay then two three five six seven nine eight then two three five six seven eight nine what yes its going to be the same as number five because thats the switch and then it goes through one last iteration what are you doing inaudible  five out of  what did i get wrong okay incorrect it does not tell me the right answer one yeah its number eight and i put one how did you know its using binary switch i didnt know it was related to that i thought it was something else i got question nine wrong as well and thats  its linked to the other one thats why i got it wrong it doesnt show you the right answer what crosstalk  i like how you like turned to convince me crosstalk  question eight is question nine is not the first thing i dont know you have a lot i heard yeah inaudible  everywhere and its useless crosstalk  no i apologize to this recording hey dont do that to me im not redoing it im not there i cannot write all this over again i got  i got seventeen wrong answer one what yeah i got this wrong there im not its fine its whatever sarah one one crosstalk  one crosstalk  yeah yeah the second time was not intentional what slowly recording yes yes it is okay okay so crosstalk  give me an array crosstalk  oh cant  crosstalk  whoa im starting the for loop theres a for loop in an order to display it  youre creating the arrays inside that main array and reusing two different random numbers in order to generate how many arrays you have and how big those arrays are going to be  i believe so then youre good so oncrosstalk  noah has filled them with random numbers wait whatcrosstalk  excuse youre making one multidimensional array which uses two sets of the little brackets main array then you use two different size things and both of those are randomly generated so you need two random numbers you do the new int size  size  in the bracket crosstalk  all like that  crosstalk  yeah well be like nazarene crosstalk  okay dont do that crosstalk  lets see crosstalk  what yes  yes i believe its a coordinates of the grid crosstalk  if im reading this correct  yeah so this is the example  that means its  across and  whatever  but if you want it different sizes then you can you do it this way but right now were not doing it that way you predefine em which i i dont know so its the same way you do regular arrays you just put two brackets sidebyside yes but you need two brackets in the beginning  two brackets crosstalk  count   its going so far inaudible  crosstalk  yes i believe thats what the sizes are automatically doing because then the next thing it asks you is to go ahead and display it yeah i can use this loop crosstalk  for that too crosstalk  yeah yeah that day crosstalk  count crosstalk   what do you mean  so the main array is main array length in order to figure out which count youre on youre going to have create an integer that represents that crosstalk   you use a count thats going to go until the end of the main array length which is how many but you dont know how many there are right now  yes then for that you put the count inside whatever order it is so x o or x or x whatever then you just put length for that so itll calculate it crosstalk  mmhmm  thats what im doing its a for loop within a for loop  the count is to understand where you are on the you could probably use i instead  yeah you can use i crosstalk  thats easier isnt there another way to do a random number besides mathrandom then its easier yeah crosstalk  whats the random class  its random integer crosstalk   okay need to pull off inaudible  i dont know how to do the randomcrosstalk  random whatchu doin crosstalk  lets see at crosstalk  zero inclusives crosstalk  ah so plus crosstalk   its about its going to be  crosstalk  eight is that right if im wanting to do  to  its rannextint and then  on the outside to make it between  and   okay  then that one is  inaudible crosstalk  oh shit its gonna be  for loops i think its not gonna be just  because you need a second coordinate for the array for the thing to assign it i think its not letting me assign that to crosstalk  main array like main array blah blah blahcrosstalk  oh okay no nevermind i got it its fine im sure its fine so crosstalk  i have the two for loops and its main array i right nowcrosstalk  but thats the entire array so you need to be able to hit everything in the array so you need another coordinate in order to get everything i cant see that from that far away no ohhhhh sweet crosstalk  no i think it works i was just trying to use a comma instead then let me copy that  crosstalk  woocrosstalk   oh okay crosstalk  okay  i is the row so the j is the column crosstalk   say what crosstalk  youll have to call each maybe instead of incrementing j you increment i to add em just switch the i but keep the j the same number to add em together crosstalk  youre going to get the crosstalk  right so you would the same way you would try and add together stuff in a regular array instead of just adjusting the location the index for that way youre just adjusting the main array index crosstalk  switch the order that youre doing itcrosstalk  put crosstalk  is the j and the inner loop is the i because the i is one to the join count youre going to count down for the j loop crosstalk  then across the next index i keep visualizing it the way the dasani machine gets drinks it goes up and then over and then down you just have to follow the lines crosstalk  inaudible  inaudible  crosstalk  ah excuse inaudible  it did not    do what i needed it to crosstalk  ohhh balls why is it crosstalk  okay  do we have to do cool cool cool  i was worried that we had to do descriptions or pseudo code or something crosstalk  i guess ill put crosstalk   i didnt put a header but crosstalk  averages crosstalk  description crosstalk  inaudible  arrays do that  okay so crosstalk  this crosstalk  thats fine im trying to do it now i told you how to do it and now i forgotten how to do it  i need to know what im doing right now im blanking on everything my head hurts screwed me up i dont need to do thatcrosstalk  okay so crosstalk  this can wait crosstalk    come back to timestamp  arraycrosstalk  comment will be crosstalk  the total number of elements will be the first size times the second size right crosstalk  okay uh crosstalk  how short why are you where are you sorting why just use the bubble god whats the called the linear search method and just go through everything and if its higher than whatever  let me find the linear search i think it might be two  search java lets see now give me that sweet sweet example code where is that search so its one for loop if such and such is equal to crosstalk  okay crosstalk  equals crosstalk  yeah youve not been evaluating crosstalk  thats pretty jackedup yeah ive been doing these ones right  did you have to make a bunch of arrays for average and stuff like that uhhuh size  yeahcrosstalk  sure fine i think im doing this right  okay crosstalk  lets see if this worked it did not for what  crosstalk  why one i was so suddenly conscious of my voice and trying not to do it in a weird voice just because you were in front of me i was dont do it in a weird voice have you looked at the multidimensional the one with three brackets what is the third bracket for so it is a cube instead of a spare in each of the things it is also an array which is why it is a cube right yes that is why i was not quite sure because it was asking what is in blah blah blah and i was like  but i did not understand that it was asking for length it said what is the contents of something and i was like what yeah it does not tell me what is in there one two wow one two three equals yeah hey chris is there a way to if somebody puts input and it is stored into it it is just going to drop whatever period is like if i have a user inputting the column with their whatever and they try and do something cheeky that is not going to mess it up right just a negative right so as long as i do a loop for a negative i can yeah  okay what oh right yeah that is true yeah what with arraysstring and then you return whatever in the method did you put it in a different method then you just put return are you returning a specific thing within array just put the name not the brackets because they will return the whole thing the lab does that i think i have to do the four  move four columns four rows four  crosstalk  oh shit we are supposed to make separate methods to do this it is inaudible  section  do you have a textbook there crosstalk  it is going well i am trying to decide how much needs to go in the main method and how much needs to go in other methods because  but the array should be initialized in the main method shouldnt it because i trying to call the array in the main method and there is no array oh so it will return essentially okay cool inaudible  so this returns average sign off here so it says calculates the average of all elements that means just one average right okay each column it is you use the same thing i used for filling it four and times zero crosstalk  a number to a what get char i think or the opposite of that you are wanting to find the character of whatever number was input uhhuh  mmhmm affirmative you can randomly generate a character straight up without doing a character like that create random class that we did inaudible  the file uhhuh was it the wrap that we had to display the array with cutting it off after a certain point that loop in order to display that nice little block or was it this most recent activity okay shit crosstalk  okay sweet sweet sweet nothing at all crosstalk  inaudible  four should i i am still doing the first one for columns and rows does that have to be in the method too or can that be in the main method because she said initially it was the main was just for column in methods i would like to have an answer to both i tried to put  yeah i tried to put the entirety of this in the fill array thing but then it just would not prompt me for anything so i guess like oh right now it is working fine but before i had all of the prompt stuff in the array okay no i had the scanner and then when it first was saying enter the column size that is in there so it never actually had a display line in the main method and it did not have the first inch column input next in there that was in an array or in a method inaudible  whatever okay what you are going to have to create an array in the name of the inaudible   yeah if you started it in the main method then yes yeah uhhuh  so this is a void so that is not going to return anything to the main array yeah and then you are going to have return and the name of the array that is in that method at the bottom you just return double inaudible   as long as it is within the method yeah it has to be the last thing you do it is the name of the array that you are wanting to get back no no no no just the name of the array not double or none of the brackets and that will bring it back from wherever you are calling it from so if you need it for anything then you are going to have to create an array up there and put it whatever array equals that method you called no that is all right yes so since you have it initialized in there you are going to have to and it is calling itself name it something else create another array be like filled array or something use a different one and see if that works because the way that i did it was i called  yeah well instead of doing  yeah because it does not have the two things because that double you are going to have to put the brackets in that method between where it says initialized array and double it needs the brackets to show that it is an array you are going to return otherwise it just returns one double okay yeah one yeah yeah no problem oh youre gonna have to deal with laughs oh no hold on no you dont have to okay lets continue talking boisterously the way we have been forever and ever urgh lets put this down here anyway just to make sure its still i dont think wait yeah it is okay good yeah please okay the matrix for these conversations uh i dont i dont know why you need to create a random number in order to do it because you could just put that in the thing  so you can you know when you fill the arrays you put the two different coordinates in order to get that specific element box to fill you could just put a random number like instead of putting a second coordinate for the the row or column or whichever one that we have to do you can just put random number and it will select them you just make sure its within the thing i havent tested it yet so i could be talking instead of j just do that instead of creating a a whole number its extra do we oh thats for the search yeah no we only need one loop for the first thing oh yeah yeah no way to check no i think im okay right now i havent tested it but im so well see hm void so i need this loop again no not that loop i need this loop again i love being able to cycle this at least check oh i dont know if this will work but maybe it will is this attached to okay uh for for the booleans if we um if we put them in if condition we dont have to put true its just if its true it will go right for the booleans yeah yeah okay lets see if this fucking works i mean fricking works thank you mike okay the answer is no its not even printing the thing right now laughs i pressed i pressed enter and it was just like nah oh you know what i bet its because yeah my search method did not work  sixtytwo crosstalk  i think theres still review im part of that class now thank you quit trying to start shit honestly i dont know do you want,guess  yeah  sure  yeah  say  need  make  sure  dont  get  really  fast  okay  including  youre  saying  right  good  thing  lot  say  thats  fine  said  supposed  use  f  statement  right  cant  use  mean  probably  could  oh  oh  least  want  code  farm  like  going  given  somebody  else  theyre  going  total  dick  put  realized  im  person  testing  im  going  there  reason  double  case  yeah  let  girlfriend  test  thing  like  try  first  thing  write  like  oh  hmm  man  commentary  riveting  like  length  silence  brought  dedication  right  let  oh  yeah  thats  theyre  using  f  statement  shape  equal  ignore  case  whatever  mmhmm  affirmative  oh  shit  theyve  already  initialized  cant  mention  oh  f  statement  shape  equal  ignore  case  square  clear  string  instead  initialize  prompt  user  individual  like  thing  need  develop  problem  result  equal  yeah  put  result  initialize  yeah  shape  dot  equal  ignore  case  put  quotation  whatever  name  yeah  default  put  statement  dont  ignore  case  look  like  close  time  let  go  ahead  save  start  putting  do  okay  let  see  dont  know  thats  correct  formatting  see  see  oh  need  oh  wait  going  need  double  probably  yeah  result  double  wasnt  much  effect  yeah  okay  think  feel  like  easy  wait  every  time  think  im  thing  right  way  im  like  dont  get  way  hard  im  wrong  easy  im  like  im  pretty  sure  im  wrong  supposed  loop  didnt  say  loop  eh  oh  didnt  second  part  bummer  oh  two  need  get  closer  thats  fine  good  yeah  cool  cool  cool  question  initializing  new  array  since  getting  user  define  size  array  new  ant  put  new  ant  input  next  ant  bracket  letting  dont  know  thats  proper  could  instead  creating  new  ant  equal  putting  new  ant  bracket  seems  like  extra  step  source  size  yeah  going  use  source  size  anything  else  okay  yeah  okay  cool  cant  verify  oh  right  right  know  something  think  lab  test  making  lot  value  stuff  like  dont  really  need  could  break  like  formula  whatever  could  use  may  homework  pi  something  there  math  dot  pi  instead  mmhmm  affirmative  math  dot  pi  cap  yeah  thats  got  correct  number  assigned  rounded  weird  yeah  yeah  long  got  mine  like  something  decimal  pi  itll  calculate  shit  ton  digit  yeah  okay  right  right  right  okay  trying  figure  pace  four  seven  zero  tag  think  math  dot  random  time  zero  nine  could  also  well  maximum  minus  minimum  plus  one  order  max  minus  min  plus  one  max  minus  min  plus  one  get  exactly  youre  well  look  api  think  think  tell  little  bit  one  paragraph  yeah  cool  please  please  add  point  test  wait  let  get  please  add  point  test  talking  think  think  right  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  want  ten  thats  would  would  one  minus  ten  minus  one  plus  one  something  like  hey  nelson  going  able  use  stuff  im  paying  attention  okay  shuffling  god  sure  sure  know  okay  know  bring  preseven  sound  awful  okay  gosh  equal  math  dot  random  yeah  capitalized  right  oh  first  math  isnt  supposed  oh  okay  class  random  yeah  yeah  yeah  youre  wearing  sandal  yeah  check  check  say  pseudo  random  still  count  say  next

does it matter where it goes all right because i was going to say just put it  yeah all right is that good extra desk crosstalk  every time theyre listening to everything we say basically yeah why arent inaudible  its going to be a whole bunch of me just talking to myself from i just read out what im doing like randomly so oh yeah if not you cant use a switch a switch but i mean if its more ill do it with this yeah yeah ive started always doing like when we have these ill put a while in there that says like make input a valid thing and like thats a good thought but its the same thing im the one doing it so im not going to intentionally mess up and then  oh this inaudible  we shouldve had a little intro dont listen to this if nothing its just static what was the  what was she saying crosstalk  i want these strings i dont know we have to enter the name of the shape i was just doing like one is square two is that kind of thing is that a thing what are you doing for your end statements im just drawing a blank on like all of the string thing that arent in inaudible  yeah and then you call them that yeah so youre using crosstalk  for this string the f statement okay and you dont have to do it because its ignoring the case you can add like whatever inaudible  oh that should be that one what oh yeah they all have to be double yeah i yeah i did them all as ifs at first too what boom yeah spepci  what no im going to slam it im going to hit the table probably  no no no i can give you more cord  you sure the only thing with that though is you cant verify  if they put something not in the range that its asking for  yeah yeah oh there is oh i didnt know that  mmhmm affirmative for the homework i did  or something i just did a bunch of decimals because i didnt think they wanted more specific than that  but then i formatted it so i did print and i made it two decimals  yeah  its math random times the  times  or is it times nine plus one  right so nine minus zero is nine yeah but i think the plus one gets added after it right crosstalk  min plus one or nine minus min plus min okay  and then its crosstalk  its weird theres another way ill try  thats easy  what the min is zero yeah but is it like this yeah hey we can fill in here if you want to oh but were attached hey were moving left chris were shuffling get ready  just to fill in this gap a little bit just make sure youre close enough that way i dont throw the recorder  okay  cool oh wait i just got it its math random times upper minus lower plus one plus lower so its upper minus lower times math random then after that add one then after that you add in this case zero  yeah i always have to look up how to do math random  yeah i was doing that before but a bunch of the homeworks and stuff said do math random  oh okay  i used to be like that and i was like thats terrible  pseudo random oh  uh huh  i mean you could try it crosstalk   all right was it you do for it and just keep counting because of it you have to copy you dont have to do i dont know what the pseudo random thing is you were talking about  if you make a new random and then you do just random dot next and it starts at zero  right so you have to do ten  yeah right  make the size of the loop bigger so you make the loop like in  yeah but then in the loop are you talking about in the loop make it source and then in brackets i  source like the array the brackets put the i in the brackets  that was wednesday  yeah i can do that  last time we sat around and studied for like  minutes and then yeah for the next four hours we just did random shit  yeah just from the book straight from the book  and because a lot of the stuff in the book yeah yeah  yeah but we probably started about like two  all right  what yeah i mean were hooked to our i literally have like after one i have that whole day so  i mean we could split it  we dont all have to be there like we did last time  we could do like after  like we did for yeah yeah  yeah and i can do both and split half of it  mmhmm affirmative wait what no  one of the things in the book it says you have to specifically go through every single thing yeah im pretty sure  you have to loop and say print zero print one print two print three  what so it says find the max value of array is that like what does it mean find the max value yeah so but you have to four loop that right  yeah no you dont have to  what you have to four loop it and say yeah you display source dot i or not yeah and then not dot i source and then in brackets i  yeah i did this c so quick but i still dont get how to do b i mean i know what were supposed to do but i dont know how to go about actually doing it  what if all the numbers randomize at zero though no  yeah  it has to be great than or equal to because its equal to and you set it to its still the same thing  is that still in the same four loop though is that all in one loop okay crosstalk  if check equals plus nine if check random i was going to say like where could yeah how big was the piece of bread like just a yeah not at once hopefully but oh my god  fold it you could fold it  one piece of bread in  seconds  dude if i had bread for some reason in my bag i would try right now  i got to prove that thats exactly what we just said  thats bread  ducks can beat everybody  time me click  dang it not better than the time i have to beat oh gosh four two count four zero  what lets see crosstalk  oh oh  they just left nah i doubt they finished they just probably im on d i havent done anything with d but i just finished c  d  mmhmm affirmative i literally skipped to c and she told me how to do b she told me how to do b i didnt know how to do it  i mean it looks like it would right i stole your truck variable crosstalk   thats always been hes like this is probably going to cause problems sum divided by size  that is a silly question no im just kidding crosstalk   b so thats the one yeah you just keep it like i dont know you take like you have a variable right that checks that the element of the array that youre at so as its going right  what no no because part a is like youre randomizing this is saying like yeah yeah then you take that you have a highest value variable what no you want to start the max at zero  because thats like then basically in the four loop youre checking if the value is bigger than that if it is then you set the max to that bigger value yeah but it might not always be nine crosstalk  right exactly  if the average the total  oh shit do you need that  i dont think i have to do that  oh no the index is just going to be like i so we just put yeah the max  yeah  wait what say that again sorry mmhmm affirmative  right  right so you just yeah  yeah but you only want to do it once when you get the max value once youve hit the cap you want it to be like the first time  then i guess you print the first one because you dont want to print all them  wait did she say to print that i was just planning on printing out the first one but i didnt know we had to print out all of them  yeah  yeah once you get the max you go back through and check every time its equal to it yeah crosstalk   tomorrow when oh i dont know probably tomorrow night because tomorrow were going through all the oh oh i dont know it probably is by the start but theyre going to change it crosstalk   oh no yeah i just used literally the same one  yeah no im not i dint finish it  i did not its   im waiting  oh no plastic two  yeah what teams are yall on hey yeah im on red red yeah its an easy choice come on chris searching is the processing wait what searching searching wow what two i think i got  crosstalk  wait which one are you on crosstalk  i cant even see it no like i just forget it well do that later crosstalk  i cannot conclude crosstalk  what no the number im on eight right now what its one no its one its looking for six its not looking at the six index its looking for the index of sixe for eight like when its the method well that was what they were talking about crosstalk  what so its looking for eight in the red what question hang on yeah so what are they chris went and picked it up he was like he said it was like recording like two hours or something but it wasnt yeah yeah thirteen fourteen you have a film for me i left the music your help is toprated crosstalk  no were good crosstalk  whats up with ten inaudible  for ten inaudible  crosstalk  theres no six here lets see our method like this crosstalk  thats weird i wonder how sensitive the mics are like every time they look at ours they just hear yall and they look at yours and they hear ours isnt linear search i dont get why it would be binary and not linear search crosstalk  yeah but i mean if the ray is  like i know if the ray is like  things long but like are yall planning on making a ray that big hang on i dont even know what the  what are you talking about yeah me neither wait start again adobe what oh wait thats weird that should be free no adobe reader is free dude what is twelve you have the book youre past twelve right what is twelve lower i mean above thirteen and then whats thirteen was this bubble sort i thought selection sort was the host one where it kept going from the top yeah see again i feel like the selection sort is so much easier but like inaudible  selection sort its so much easier to like  its so much cleaner looking oh my bad inaudible  crosstalk  oh god crosstalk  so is fourteen bubble then yeah yeah but so is this okay what question is that thirteen crosstalk  its multiple and then neighboring its on page  apparently wait  nice eight crosstalk  the bubble sort crosstalk  so sixteen is selection if the other one  if fourteen is bubble is sixteen selection thats the other did you do this one oh okay uhoh were good crosstalk  i dont get any of this crosstalk  oh crosstalk  whoa whoa whoa go back i dont  i think  i guess  but thats just sort youre lucky you dont have the restraining orders okay so crosstalk  get a restraining order again to you dude this is  why are we  no inaudible  sort automatically hes like breaking his voice crosstalk  yeah i want to get like the sound files and sync them up together and just listen back to them how awful that would be  sixteen crosstalk  selection what selection that was one of the ones that she did up here that was the first one that she did no today she did selection and then bubble which is this one yeah she did this twice but it was different this code the code didnt change but she did selection on the board manually yeah crosstalk  yeah yeah thats why i was confused i dont know did you do fifteen im talking to my partner right here ive got a grader on the exit form oh i see so wait this is identical yeah this ones just first because its supposed to  so like three five two yeah inaudible  you know inaudible  how he had to move have you seen mikey hes my favorite hes so excited to be here  mikeys my favorite inaudible  just kidding inaudible  two types of technically okay so for this one this one should be three five two so shouldnt this be three two five if its three five two then it and then it goes to two three five i dont get how the order is like if the first ones switch does it do the first ones again thats my question so its three five two now does it do  okay so if this is  my question if this is three five two right two five three so this line is right then yeah so then two should be just this again oh jesus like that it should literally just be like that that would be the technical first term so it would switch eight and six or eight and seven thats what i two three five yeah i know what the last ones supposed to be inaudible  what um were not doing dont move it thats not going to do anything so its  right which one are you on so did you get the right order for on number four then okay thats what i  because that makes it thats what i wanted to make sure inaudible  already breaking out of what yeah what did you get wrong and does it tell you the right answer asking for a friend what number is that eight number eight is negative one because its not one because this isnt sorted its using binary switch and its not sorted because the one above it you tell it that its using binary switch what did you put yeah have you seen my inaudible  yeah what crosstalk  it was all chris fault i promise crosstalk  fault wrong huh the whole thing what wait what how come every time you sit in the chair it screams at you crosstalk  what is it yeah is that still recording two trying not to drop it this time  were you able to figure something out crosstalk  what crosstalk  yeah im always having something for inaudible  crosstalk  dude thats kind of  crosstalk  inaudible  what what for loop okay so is a asking to put each array give it another array the arrays in the array  with other random numbers or something else  okay so you make an array youre make one array  and just so you know crosstalk  okay so are you doing it when you define the array  when you make the array are you using two bracket sets and each of those is a random number its the coordinates even when you initialize it okay  how did you sorry how did you initialize it oh crosstalk  point the array crosstalk  okay so youre making the d arrays thats minimum x maximum x because its random right crosstalk  then youre filling each of those elements with a random number from   yeah but its saying fill the array so you have to fill it first crosstalk  well i could show a for loop through it and be like bam so how do you get the length of one crosstalk  but thats like the columns so then itll go sideways  okay why dont you just use a second for loop then whats the count  yeah thats what i had  because youre bad inaudible  wait cannot invert length oh yes if you input the random class or whatevercrosstalk  it is i asked david how to do it and he said just do that one its so much easier and it is thats what ive been using  now im crying a little so like crosstalk  random name its newrandom then to call it you do the randomnextint then you have to do the little formula crosstalk   crosstalk    crosstalk  yeah cause it starts at  thats the weird thing you have to count you take the difference   what im glad you got it cause i didnt understand it im here hold on can you see it now really now i dont know if that works oh yeah i dont knowcrosstalk  i ran mine in the first thing it did it its like a x and im like crosstalk  then i ran it again and it said normal  i just got really luckycrosstalk  calculate the average of numbers in each columncrosstalk  print the averagecrosstalk  j  calculate the average of numberscrosstalk  ow thank you dancrosstalk  calculate the average of numbers in each column crosstalk  dont use mathrandom use the other one  crosstalk  okay crosstalk  so i and j is i the column or is j the column crosstalk  so how do you add the columns together how do you add the columns together crosstalk  crosstalk  in the j loop that wont work cause its still gonna run through j as many times as the arrays crosstalk  oh like the outer loop is the crosstalk  i think i know it crosstalk  i just have to like crosstalk  thats deepcrosstalk  oh what crosstalk  where where what inaudible   i want coordinates but are you actually crosstalk  what  to be fair pokemon is better  what no my crosstalk  my header is literally like inaudible  then the description is just activity  crosstalk  i put it just because that im like  sure we dont need it  holy shit i did it first try i cant believe it i just did what you said to do so i mean you get all the credit crosstalk  crosstalk  hey nazarene put angie in our group please  oh oops inaudible  crosstalk  what the main one  it randomly you have to make it randomly think  both length and crosstalk  yeah both of them are its either the minimum it can be is x and the max it can be is x but it can be anything crosstalk  yeah it can be like x or x crosstalk  oh wait the average of this isnt divided by  its divided by crosstalk  crosstalk  crosstalk  how do we do the thing where we go through and search the im on the last step but the one where the sort how do you sort them  yeah like smallest to largest  inaudible  like selection sort i think that would work crosstalk  at the end it says find the max average then the way im doing it is im putting each of the averages into array like we did in lab for the deck of cards  yeah how do i do that its one for loop right yeah if average array of i  x then next  integer array of i crosstalk  yeah okay that works crosstalk  oh shit you know what i just realized on the exit forum were supposed to check all of he prime for these ive only been reading the top one because i thought it was like the top one was the best and the bottom one was the worst it was one of those rate your crosstalk  so ive only been doing this one crosstalk  yeah but im evaluating you crosstalk  so in my other ones you have not been responding or valuing or organizing  well at least youre on recording saying that crosstalk  so hopefully you do take that into account no i just used one array for the average and then the main array i only have two arrays you know that deck of cards thing we did its kind of like that where you have a parallelogram  oh brandon oh nevermind crosstalk   whats up  yeah i know crosstalk  yeah i just had the average array that was the same size as the like how many columns there were crosstalk  crosstalk  then i just assigned each average to i just went through the averages assigned each one to the array it took the biggest one  am i good if i close this i mean i already did but crosstalk  oh shit that would be me inaudible  crosstalk  crosstalk  david david can you crosstalk  two that is the third dimension yeah so there is one two and then three have you done the quiz that is due tomorrow morning yeah what is the length that is what i put there is a billion other inaudible  ruth whats up crosstalk  now wait two dimensional that is the squared one right that is rows and columns yeah  crosstalk  look at this i have been working on assignment three how do we return in array how do we return in array no not display return it out of the method yeah no it says  no yeah define the method that calculates the average  crosstalk  how do i get the length of the second inaudible  okay thank you man i just did the quiz too yeah i live through this class and i am tired and then we get to the lab in the morning and i am tired again yeah for  yeah for missing all these other classes nah yeah okay whatever you say no i have not is that an offer no i am just kidding yes the answer is yes i have a question for you while on the topic of attendance i know i missed a lab but it does not say i missed a lab oh okay so do you have that i missed a lab okay okay okay and it is if you miss more than two or if i miss one more i am screwed okay because i am not planning on missing lab but  okay okay  cool  you change that no i am just kidding but what a goofy though he just walked away you have two bracket sets yeah the first size is the first bracket the second size is the second bracket you have to have two inputs yeah dude i woke up this morning and this dude had messaged me at six in the morning just him playing league was that really since last night oh my god inaudible  for  yesterday they talked about getting help if you have an addiction and you were like we are going to send you there define a method that could   mmhmm affirmativehe has it he has it where you can look he has it where you can see how much he has played yeah what may i ask a question inaudible  why is that not what we have been using for the longest time but it is not a inaudible  oh okay yeah so do you just put them inside it does not make a difference right inaudible  what who knows it is their loss yeah yeah it is not like the one we had to do each  it is all of them okay you do not have the return inaudible  right it is not inaudible  i just threatened inaudible  is it not the same thing this hmm okay so it is the right way of doing it is it this how do we convert a number to a character character no it says you have to randomly generate a character right so i was doing it with numbers but i want to turn that number into a character oh wait hang on wait what why is that not working nevermind the inaudible  is doing its work i was just being dumb i did not have it in parenthesis you can later do the type casting thing you can just sort of inaudible  and then the number crosstalk  i think it was tuesday all right thanks so there has been a second one it says you have to do a search method for the character and if you find it you have to return the index of the inaudible  up there how do you return the index of a two dimensional array as one inaudible  twice uhhuh that is what i was thinking too but like  because it asks you to return the index and if it is two dimensions you have to return two numbers right right yeah it wants you to return the inaudible  character okay okay okay so it would just be like  yeah yeah and you could straight up just say i and j right  like that okay cool oh i know  what you do  why why but you are taking the int so then you basically just default these to negative one then but if you do not find the character as the negative one but  okay because it tells you to make it in the method i mean yeah skylar normally you would yeah you better be sorry i am not david no you said you were going to ask david first inaudible  all right what oh yes okay you are trying to return the array right in where you have public static double you have to put brackets after that double yeah because you are returning the array not the double yeah yeah that is what i tried to do you can use the exact same array i am pretty sure if i understand the question no i am not laughing at that two you might have to extend the cord wow do i need to oh yeah while while recording laughs nice nice is it still going okay  i was gonna say twelve twelve research recordings in which i talk to other people and laughs so yeah this didnt work what i did up there didnt work what oh i know uhhuhaffirmative mmhmm affirmative mmhmm affirmative wouldnt that mean instead of a variable oh yeah yeah yeah oh i see what youre yeah yeah yeah yeah you can do that that works fine dude the probability of you winning this thing is like one out of like like i cant i dont know if im gonna actually like if i have it right cause im still here and im just it refuses to let me win laughs wait did she say did she say how to get it  how do you get it to do it when you hit enter how do you get it to do it when you hit enter like i have it printing out just the whole thing but up there it says like when you print enter it should print the next step okay okay but that makes it even harder to translate cause like now you can sit here and enter until you win all right imma just take this no what yeah but you look over there thats a whackass circle bro look at circles were after hinges were after this circle over refused dude the chances oh my god yo this is how the lottery works dude its just you keep getting yeah i have yet to win ive been so close so many times ill get like four to five thats true yeah but then i have to go back and change it killing my work i have to go back and change it yeah but like no still low im gonna say congratulations you won thank you for clicking enter millions of times ha good job laughs laughs thats how i live my life im so tired of seeing that i lost dude shiieeeeet wait what yeah if like if boolean and then if boolean is equal to true elsewhere then itll run it still works if you say like if boolean equal to true but you dont have to do this laughs nice wait what nah dude thats a good question yeah also it didnt work even when it was supposed to work so thats why yeah i just rigged it and set like a whole row to or like a whole column to one yeah laughs ooh okay sky sky i dig it i dig it laughs yeah no start like rapping laughs yeah wait what laughs yeah that end of the mic yo reed hurry dude hurry up and do it and then we can like we can just like sit here and play league laughs i said hurry up and do it and we can just sit here and play league just like laughs yeah good do it crosstalk  bruh you you yeah you have to it wasnt a suggestion like you cant play normal games unless theyre a certain level but theyre real easy you play like six of them you can literally like all run down dude we could literally run down like one lane and like win it like we could run down one lane and win it like for the bot games they dont theyre awful theres literally no point to jungling in the bot games you can trilane bot and yeah yeah they dont carry good yeah yeah youre still drafting david laughs dude you put it there reed stupid i love how you put the mic closer to you like every single search laughs i did all kinds of work today yes i did laughs laughs get on league exit from your game do the exit form do the exit form do it haha laughs i dont think thats how that works reed yeah yeah yeah laughs yeah its kinda like not like that i mean like the first half is but then like the i dont yeah like the second half of like checking it that didnt work at all so i used like a parallel array that said like if the randomly generated number all five times is equal to itself then we win does that make sense yeah i dont think thats how youre supposed to do it yeah laughs wait theres not but the other no not were not talking about were talking about  go away im just kidding laughs inaudible  you wish you were in that class not really you dont wanna be in that class whoa all right you know what im leaving dude somebody get this microphone  bruh ill do that if you actually do the exit form and you play a game like right now like in here like i swear to god you have the track pad the track pad does angela have her borrow angelas if she has hers what yeah were gonna play normal dude we got like  minutes play something like really shitty that you dont need oh no cause you gotta move still yeah yeah hes actually just mad yeah yeah dude just yeah turn it you can turn it back on i can write on em i dont know how to do it on there yall have wait yall have like the same laptop what all right im closing this dude play aram okay  im playing a bot game unless brandon shows up but thats even more of a role play line than if its three unless were up against bots but like laughs yeah dude fucking reed we got a karthus jungle in our game and like as soon as it happened he was like yo send it to brandon show him he needs to see crosstalk  well track pad track pad fortnite dude,matter  go  right  going  say  put  yeah  right  good  extra  desk

all right so then the user needs to choose the  you want straight to the  so this one is for choosing right so if one  for the dimensions if its a square its going to be for one side if its a rectangle it has to be two then the program needs to do the and the print is in the rectangle right this one is just for processing this that one is for showing the result right no that wasnt my question im talking about the figures if one then you ask for the side this is the rectangle that shows thats what im trying to say the rectangle is the one that  its not showing its processing the formula the method but its not showing this is going to show sorry if not then they can choose  im still behind this is yes right yeah so then its going to go to another if trying to remember what is the formula for the rectangle otherwise i dont understand what im doing thats what it says thats in the program or thats in inaudible  right i dont know thats a triangle im still behind you can  excuse me double because of the answer what is that crosstalk  yeah im almost done im almost done if not then we cancel it right you have to crosstalk  yeah inaudible  i missed two steps ill fix later but i know what it is youre writing now im sorry all right i think its recording its working now  oh yeah why are you sure are we creating our method if you read right here it says  im just going to follow you because i dont really know i thought it was supposed to be crosstalk  statements but do we have to do  can we just use that one the first one because youre doing that right what did i do yes im sorry im not  yeah its the scanner first no yeah choose from the following menu what about the exit can we add another one inaudible  it doesnt say in this we can fix that later why a string so it shouldnt be  how do you do that because were given one two three four i feel we have to use the if but inside the if we have to create our own method why are we using a string again no i know that but what are they going to enter a square no no no but that i know so the thing is that theyre going to get confused if we put one square crosstalk  so lets keep going then string choice its not n next line thats what it is so then we have to use the if if choice equal to square oh yeah because how do you do that which one are you looking for so its choice dot ignore case equals ignore case ignore case yeah sorry no its not choice its equals ignore case dot choice in parentheses i did something wrong here inaudible  its not capitalized this is what it says equals ignore case and then in parentheses its one thats just  i think its square it doesnt have to be capitalized right yeah what if they enter  oh yeah nevermind i got it crosstalk  were using the bubble right why oh yeah you have to start the scanner again yeah because you put crosstalk  no youre not supposed to use double i mean the uppercase double length whatd you use for  you cant use length because then youre going to use length and width its not going to  side s side square side because we dont want to confuse  are justin ganey  and austin rogers here what are we doing now so it should be inaudible  double and the square wait im sorry im sorry crosstalk  why you do that this one the double result yeah i got confused i thought it was the other way but okay im going to follow you because  double result square then were finished with that right no no no i mean  now you finished the double im sorry because i thought it was the other way around so youre doing it differently double side its giving me an error why are you confused thats fine its the same thing she didnt call it right there the one that youre using here the double result thats why i was confused it shouldnt be inaudible  no because its going to give us a double answer it can be but is that what she wants but im saying is that  that one that youre doing right now i dont think that should be there the one that you just corrected mmhmm affirmative that is funny im trying to think theyre done so we did that right the problem we declared that then now here this is going to print the result right thats what youre doing with the double right now thats the thing i dont think thats supposed to be there i think its supposed to go straight to the print thats what i mean but we dont have that yet at least we have that first and it runs then we can do the rest you used square i used something else crosstalk  no no youre good im just getting confused it takes me a minute to realize what im yes so you got the inaudible  double and then square in parentheses thats double side thats correct what about the results it shouldnt affect that why you have to use also the  oh you got those what about the double result thats what its asking you thats different thats what they wanted us to do that should be it but its not working crosstalk  twice for result because oh yeah i thought it was double im just getting right here it shouldnt matter because we have the side here then it ran it put it in  it shouldnt matter it shouldnt matter see what it says here you dont need to open that one you went too far no you went too far i think its in the next one crosstalk  because those are the ones on the top yeah you can try it but thats not for that one crosstalk  huh why no it shouldnt be a loop you want to do the loop for the whole thing or just for this youre just throwing ideas yeah inaudible  now let me catch up where am i why dont we use the math the math method no the pound the parentheses side its right there times two no that side erase that side and continue to two because if its a square you have to  no i didnt mean to do that crosstalk  so now i think i got something wrong its probably my words because im square side right there its right here too yeah or this one no no hold on let me  crosstalk  this is the end of the whole thing so here what is the width and the length length and width what is the length and width now we have to use  thats what i was trying to say my words sometimes they dont want to come out so then double result right its another result did we finish what no were not done one leg is hurting i want to know whats going on this one i think its because i came running thats probably  so you have to copy  hold on inside the other method you see i have two here so where do i start here i dont know crosstalk  what is giving an error its giving an error so its double length double width right length times width i dont have an error its probably brackets yeah probably brackets i dont have any the second condition thats what i was trying to tell you right here so we have to do the same thing right here right so its double all right dont we have to  okay yeah so it should be system  that its working for me put it right there the x you have to put double but not on that one on the  yeah down there yeah right here double and also width crosstalk  so it was rectangle hold on got it yeah its working so im just going to copy lets just copy i dont know im just going to go in between here right right there right so this is now the triangle what is the length now we have to height and base okay in that order not necessarily hm thats okay i dont know much of this crosstalk  hm height i think i missed an h the method should be the same thing right now if i copy this its going to go where here now it is a triangle the double height and base this changes to  you got it yeah thats the problem this is  height times base divided by two you have to put that in parentheses height times base in parentheses divided by two yeah youll get why i put in like that but thats okay four times four  divided by two eight like that so its right oh its  its right here youve got crosstalk  mmhmm affirmative you put that on the  what did you do im sorry oh yeah so the next sometimes you have to laugh that is circle that should be easiest we just do radius of the circle we only have one variable here were still working do we have to return this number three yes did you see the teaching lets go home im not its recording we cant say those things   this computer is acting up they already got it so i think its  activity  substrings i know how to do this no i dont know how to do this its right here the length we are on activity  right  okay i got lost activity  we still are using the  no were going to use methods right practice on using methods crosstalk  value develop a string method yep so we need to develop a problem that gets a string and counts the numbers of vowels write this step by pseudocode did i use  i dont know no i just did it i forgot  pseudocode yeah so prompts users  prompts users for a string do we need to put that let me copy you im not going to put a string its just too much information call the program counts vowels on the sentence count vowels call method we dont know which method right yeah call method counts vowels begin method do we have to put that too on the pseudocode we have to put everything that the problem has oh thats probably why i got you foreign language  begin method so lets create the method first its a string and numbers  just a string i think its value the string counts the number it has to return a value which parameters okay start loop for counting the vowels i guess then the problem counts  its not actually a problem its the method that counts so the method counts we should add that too method counts im going to erase that counts vowels we have to do the flowchart yeah method counts vowels but were not done yet we have to return the value that were going to display the result return our method returns  what okay number of vowels now we can do do we have to do that together individually inaudible  you have the instructions right you can put it right here so it blocks even if it falls what good you get the instructions the string yeah enter a sentence oh s its one just s that goes crosstalk  how do you call the method do you have the book i dont think we have to do that thats what im saying okay were not using any of the statement right were not going to use because were counting the  well yeah we are going to use if the user enters a number instead of a sentence  that was my bad its probably not recording all right last time i did that it went bad why are you doing that oh youre giving the count yeah but this is what were going to print this is where youre going to print the count so print how do you call it vowel count string no i didnt listen crosstalk  so were doing it wrong then mmhmm affirmative what are you doing now were supposed to do that too are we supposed to do that too how do you include that in the flowchart mmhmm affirmative its not going to show okay i was going to do the inaudible  the what i guess i dont know i dont think crosstalk  what is the name of it i dont know that i dont know that i didnt read that far  we cant do that no we cant we can use the same network with different parameters i didnt read that far so i have to go to even for three hours im probably going to fall asleep i think im wrong but okay i failed on the same thing i told you remember i told you that if you erase a fact it will inaudible  thats the same thing but i  a method  variable defining a method its not the same  i think its that one because the argument goes inside the thing we cant tell right how many methods i dont know how many methods and i dont know i thought it was four i thought it was inaudible  one two three four and five now its the next one thats an input almost forgot about this no i dont think so this is the first time i got two so im happy what is easier for you okay so lets use a while i know both i just dont know how to do current youre creating the counter then length equal extreme  length the counter is  why you using that okay i know what youre saying im still on the top because you were working while i was  the current less than yes or were gonna go that way  you put counter or count  thought he was talking to us okay im with you now mmhmm affirmative if counter is less than length loop just the vowels so what if you use a new statement saying that  how do you put a condition with the a were gonna have to use an other if while the index is less than the length of the string so if the string is not equal inaudible  gonna get above what counter are you using why you wanna create another counter so a equal  if index is equal to a e i o u then the letters the vowels i just put vowels y is not a vowel sounds like a vowel but it is not why do you think its easier to do the method first and then do the but i cant work like that i find it easier to do yes but lets finish with that so we have that then we have to print something then we have to count so we have to count eggs our printing not yet right no were not printing anything because this is the method the no goes to the end of the loop to the end of the method dont do that why not go this way now if no then it also finish the method right definitely that will not do were not doing anything else right okay so thats it then were done if you want inaudible  goes back up and then you can when you do it like this thats when you make it make bigger from here to here yeah something like that im making bigger number of vowels and x inaudible  yeah youre right then this goes up again here if the counter then it goes  it ends the method also if this and this is not  are we counting the vowels or are we counting the letters consonants what are we counting this so were counting the vowels so thats right are we have to print the l stem i dont think so right that make it too difficult no just like this one like this i think okay and i dont know how to the what yeah you can put that one there you can print that one on there i got this  this guys inaudible  i guess that should enter there okay good now were gonna go do the method right are you already printing the thing its s the name of the method is counter right counter vowel vowel count and then the s yeah so its probably  static right eight vowel count just using the strain im not using anything else counter  equals zero okay then well go for the look while whats your worry what is your question well theres a wild life so int length equals s dot length s is equal yeah youre right should be less or equal because if youre doing less its not going to take the last number yeah youre right because starts with zero youre right we have to open all the braces right just inside the loop they ask code i didnt bring it but i inaudible  i get it inaudible  to bring it today then yeah ignore case so if a sentence  if s contains ignore case no we need the index right to here no because in the condition were gonna say that we are only looking for the vowels so anything else is gonna be  it doesnt matter if we put the vowels and the consonants because in the condition were only looking for the vowels thats what im saying dont you think thats too much so if we want to do that why dont we create a variable and we just put the variable name instead of that its gonna be too messy yeah sounds could its outside the loop right or its inside the loop so im doing right so bowlian vowel equals  right here   can we do that you want the a e   f capitalized okay   im gonna have a hard time here no that lower cases we cant so lets trace that okay so counter  while counter is less than length then we want to print we want to print were probably going to have to use the program what about the a f so while counter is inaudible  so lets try that if  how do you find the counter there if s s char at zero okay no i erased it okay you didnt tag it it worked we dont need the inaudible  so let me do my  we need the applique  system its probably something else because its working for me i just need to add  let me add one of that let me add just one of those which one is the first one worked for me now you dont need that you dont need the parenthesis or  what is the other one oh you have to do the same thing so when do we declare the variable for that one thats okay its just the first part oh i know what you meant by that and then what is value then  okay  what is the other one  you need to use  let me see something you got that semicolon at the end  its working for me yes because of the x but if i get this thing inside oh okay we havent declared yet we cant do that we cant do this here what do we need that for you have to use the dial no you dont need the parentheses i dont think you need the parenthesis let me go back to what it was zero is  good crosstalk  because if you do this crosstalk  inaudible  then it goes away so you want this to be a variable just that part what is that its an int okay character no thats fine just ch can we just do a general so what can we use like that method okay hold on im just going to do this thing really which one so what is the x okay so let me change that right okay then i got the calendar we just have the ent or it doesnt matter charl ch equals charl okay so if ch is equal to oh shoot i erased that right i dont know you notice how this is so confusing what is the four one six nine okay i just inaudible  okay  okay crosstalk  okay yeah all of them need to do that i thought i got all of the errors huh just because of the  what we do no we dont need it okay lets finish with this and inaudible  which is what this one that would count what are you using now me too oh it went away number of vowels now it went up again oh we have to put the return at the end i guess its return number of vowels plus plaza oh okay number of vowels so thats last then return why is it getting at error here i know why we have to convert the vowels return integers but its not  because you would put void then it wont return them i dont know what i did so let me go back i did something wrong okay alright im back down okay whatd you say the counter goes up why have we not implemented the counter we only have one loop which is that one so we can put it right here then inaudible  if we return the counter its just gonna do the times that it when which is sixty or  thats what it is right what oh yeah do we need to turn it in okay we have to  crosstalk  i like when things work inaudible  then i get like  anxious inaudible  okay let me try this inaudible  the first one right but thats what im saying let me see if i can inaudible  right it says find the maximum value so we find it then we have to show it yeah on the first one im a little confused so why are you getting zeros because im getting a number i just inaudible  you have that in parentheses crosstalk  so youre not done oh you have to put that in parenthesis yeah the whole thing from math to the end from the start no no oh yeah yeah youre right okay no its not working you crosstalk  youre not printing it you have to print i dont know yeah not its not working not that one this one is that a nine over there nice one now you still have to print that im on the second one okay why did you put the zero okay i think im not sure no youre fine i know what it is why are you putting this outside of the loop okay crosstalk  okay crosstalk  inaudible  massive loop then were going to  oh yeah you go ahead thats fine why  oh nevermind i got it im still here so in all of them inaudible  l and m  no you cant use that okay im still on the first one nice inaudible  source i type so slow okay inaudible  crosstalk  okay that should work right oh yeah i know what it is max okay it says from ten to crosstalk  its just that yeah it still doesnt work i dont know what i did are you taking out that one thats what ive been doing too and now mines is not work so i did something wrong here okay yeah and its outside right okay now it works i think its scared of you yeah ive already doing that how many do we need were on b right okay so that should be easy why are we using that one theyre asking for the average okay are we declaring another variable i think so oh okay so youre already initializing that one to zero right okay thats right why but then we have to get the average oh okay ive already made mistakes on the other assignments i printed inside and i have to print it outside no thats fine im learning i shouldnt say that and then you go outside right crosstalk  and then i have to print the total right no outside why do you not do it in the inside okay im understanding why im confusing things no i mean on one of the assignments why are you using the inaudible  crosstalk  i was gonna put  okay im not mad at you crosstalk  you make sense because  right inaudible  i got seven and i got three i guess this is right okay were doing d right higher than the average high values no high underscore values yeah no it doesnt have to initialize leave it no leave it because right now youre gonna initialize it because you wanna initialize it with the average right here new you cant do that yet but the size is gonna be from the size of the new balance oh yeah yeah okay now you have to use the  what is the variable oh high values inaudible  yeah into that one i dont think thats right what do you mean by keep doing that we only have to have one unless you have like a menu and then you do it over there until its full didnt someone say okay you have to name it high values yeah and for this you need to create a new array with the same inaudible  and name it hight values should be new you should print it to see if it worked lower yeah inaudible  i know that crosstalk  i know that i need to do that i just dont  i have to put the mouse there so that when it starts or where it ends you already know where it goes but i think that youre doing it right because when you do the lines you just print it from here to here youre not printing them from here to here and thats what we need mmhmm affirmative yeah you can pull that you have to print the high values why not yeah i was gonna say high values plus and then the comma so it prints  you actually have to do it on the other one yeah that loop to do that what hang on oh yeah yeah yeah im just trying to  im trying to see if i can be useful okay where am i now okay nevermind im here okay youre using l right now right i did yeah im behind him but i still didnt see inaudible  though can we print the array or thats the array the array okay wow okay inaudible  im still behind so source right you  nevermind the shuffle is  you saw that one right thats my case yeah huh okay let me get back to you get back average okay yeah mmhmm affirmative then you leave inaudible  crosstalk  this is something else right like that no right there it doesnt say to display right okay what is the  let me see if i can  this is the one that were doing right yeah okay they were gonna put just random numbers n okay why because you dont have a  the no no no no youre done crosstalk  you have to plus plus plus thats what youre missing oh yeah i thought you were doing the loop im sorry nevermind i dont wanna get behind so were doing okay getting the random number right now right here im already okay in one array it wont get it until were done with that we dont have to use the array its just a number that we have right the index right were just getting a number right inaudible  okay why okay okay youre really close to what because im asking questions thats probably why okay im caught up with you do we have to print it how did they know they target okay so were done with that one okay x no target nevermind im sorry im trying to be fancy are you using the same okay should be divided by two yes but we need to divide it by two because it says half so you enter  divided by two thats half but we can use half thats good yeah now so the lens is gonna be divided by one half on the second array right no okay so like you said baby steps q we cannot use an i yeah we could have used i yeah i have too but we could have used i for all of them yeah because of different loops no and because youre just using the i for this loop after youre done with that loop then you dont need it anymore now if you declare it in the beginning then you can use it or you cannot use it but if you use it just for the loop that i know because ive been trying to do like many variables and i was declaring them in the beginning and then when i was using for the loops i couldnt use them and i put the  then i started using them just for the loop yeah of course you have to declare it again but on the loop inside the loop okay i forgot what it is crosstalk  for the first sample so if he has seven then divided by two it would have three because  you cannot unless you rounded up now how do you know no youre just using the length of here and that length should be from the source yeah what is the number for this one so why if we set it up to n no okay never mind but the only way to find out is if we print it then target q equal to source n i think right why q okay lets do that well i asked my question and when i asked them were not printing that oh youre just copying it okay i thought you were reversing it let me catch up with you oh what did i do now you didnt get yeah you got it right what is your eleven then you got it what if one of them is zero too oh youre saying  okay i know what youre saying you want it to be down there okay wow my mind because you got numbers up here did you using the  didnt you have to subtract from here so minus which this is the target right so i less but right now its q q minus one shouldnt it be q minus the length divided by two i dont know but no it should work inaudible  is the target too many temps but we shouldnt have temp two oh okay and now that is inside the loop right yeah it is why are you using the temp were not supposed to use the temp were just supposed to use target yeah but in this case we have temp here its called target its not called temp no okay and why are you using two loops okay inaudible  and the new you divided the source divided by two or not n divided by two what is  okay i got it mmhmm affirmative or equal yes no no that should run though now in theory yeah what is  you got  right okay so then divided by two is five right yeah why dont we use  okay yeah yeah now i dont know where am i yeah im on the last one sorry it does its just we dont have time i think so okay probably when i go right so the middle is target dot length divided by two okay do you have another loop no it was its just sometimes we  oh and sometimes i get lost so inaudible  okay i think im right and then outside right this one not that one over there im sorry the first one and why you have another loop there okay so are you sure this is gonna work and you put in b wow ill use yours i  i mean oh yeah i system i wasnt much help today so print it why you use yeah print and then target b its a or q plus i hope it works lets see  it didnt work sorry right there right here right here yeah that was my mistake what do you have n crosstalk  we dont have to print the rest right david left ive got to do that i have a narrative no you see this space this space right here dont we have to print every loop do we have to print every loop or the result of every point the work oh okay all right yeah i got to be careful because scatter brains might do something that im not supposed to so on the second one i think thats my problem in all my work it has to be printed outside the loop right double the loop and then print it out yeah but mostly for the loop its that otherwise it will be printing with the loop right all over how you going to print the  numbers if you put  hm oh okay do you see where i am where are you printing on the first one on a the source but it should be the array right i right oh really thats what i was saying mmhmm affirmative so system  for b  it didnt print uhhuh affirmative im just trying to make something here so if i write  then im going to have  numbers i did i just want to see playing around sorry fun somewhere we have to get the high values thats outside the loop right so just want to print one right there so system  high values right its giving me an error here thats a b now no its less than the source right its not minus one right i have no idea i think its minus one plus plus but still its giving me an error its still doing it oh okay so thats right or i have to put a comma well i did but it wasnt a good way for me plus whatever happened i actually thought this chapter was easy the only thing that i dont like is the loops i was able to do all the exercises there and get the numbers and print them out and those kind of things but when i do the loops thats when the problem happens inaudible  because i dont want to hold you up so on all these loops we have to make another loop outside of the loop david david david so for tomorrow we only have the quiz and the prelab or the postlab the prequiz that prequiz i had already i just have to finish it i have to submit it the other thing i dont think  i havent even looked what is it yeah thats the one inaudible  yeah you got it right you have another one here somewhere crosstalk  a b c d e now you should have six answers yeah you got it right yeah you got it right you have crosstalk  but its probably because you have one zero in the beginning it looks fine for me i may be mistaken now i got a problem here yeah thats the first of my problems i just dont want to  the maximum that shouldnt tell me that right right here on all of them or just that one you did put something there right so here system out you used print line or print i guess thats right did she put a time limit on here im trying to inaudible  right there and this one what they are doing here so i should write like that of system  the high values of  oh okay so that should crosstalk  crosstalk  which is this one but i didnt print it print the last two what do you mean and change it  so i want  here so outside the loop which is the source source and that should be s now you have to write hm oh ive got to change this but i already got a one on the bottom do you think that should be a problem so that should be a then right then i got to write here ive got to write down what i want to say right im learning go ahead what is this what is that what number is this this is f right the shuffle thats what it is right yeah thats the shuffle numbers in the array im thinking two times  crosstalk  it is but i dont know right here like that that didnt work no yeah i know no thats not the one thats not the one i need to do its here did i do that one lets do it crosstalk  what did i just crosstalk  right there three four five i got five thats not the one because i got that one already so its this one no i got five oh the shuffled numbers i shouldve put that let me see this is the first one i know what it is its here crosstalk  three crosstalk  we just open this every morning crosstalk  want to do right there okay i was i dont think its time though it is okay sure question one before we begin think about inaudible  each question i cant concentrate where is she now im trusting you on this one im just joking crosstalk  were declaring the variable here right here were initializing hm oh i think what its trying to do is that we have to name the parts of the code thats what i was saying part one here number one is here crosstalk  but what is it no no no because were declaring the variable the array its not initialized yeah that might be one no you sure well that i can trust you its declare but its not initialized no but number two is right here we initialize it right here so youre saying number two is one which values a four  three which are you using you were right nevermind i got it but actually thats the five thats not the two because thats what it says if you scroll up a little bit you can see the part right here part five thats where youre seeing yeah thats labeled so this one is not here so number two is number two right here is new crosstalk  okay number two which one do you choose no i think number two is the zeros no i think its well lets continue with the next one whats the three what is the four but what was to the exercise though what is x plus y or we dont have that right oh yeah x and y so x is six and y is two its eight on this one so six minus two is four x six times two is  and six divided by two is three so that one over there thats par three and probably par four and three why zero because theyre in yeah youre right it shouldnt be zero though six times  let me see return answers in part four this is returning a new array with different numbers is eight four  and three right thats what i said right okay on the top it says part five thats  we already got that one right which is eight four  and three thats correct it shouldnt be a different array because it was returned for whatever the number part two i got wrong part two what do you have on part two you dont have anything okay okay how many options you have one two three four five six i wanna have our part different array there you have another question on the bottom question three why you choose eight four  and zero i dont know you chose one okay except i dont think it returns to zero yeah and which one is the other one that youre using on three okay well i dont have that one i dont have but you know what but is this just talking about this one i dont think its talking about the whole thing its just and im choosing this one twice so i dont know number four is thats okay what is the question the values the reference okay okay you click it okay hold on dont let me see it okay three okay im  im coming im coming okay i think  okay i dont know what inaudible  but what was the answer on that one it says right here eight four  and zero but why though okay lets try  now say x  no actually its multiply six times two stroke six divided by two three no im talking about the last one because thats the answer eight four  and zero thats the only one that makes a difference now i dont see anything else zero one two did they think its this one its three i dont understand what youre saying mmhmm affirmative but x is six yeah because okay lets do b because probably that one is i dont like that inaudible  im pretty sure they made a mistake ah my computer is off so  we have a game car car game whatever this is getting real what does it say okay dont tell me you know the answers already oh it should be one less then one or two less i think youre too far okay im on  it says oh i got  for me too  yeah it is  its  youre on  right here thats the one you have to read  somewhere else it is  they were pointing on the same place reference inaudible  ah this is too much be zero five right you wanted six now what is passed on here the number would you say right on the method not inaudible  its this but it should not how did it change though okay thats a good question a is one so it goes back to  what about that one so it changes here it says the array b in paths if you change the array and the method then it changes also in the men so that solves that right so thats false inaudible  also have stayed back in the main okay so this one is false thats also true what youre saying its good the way it is sorry alright okay hmm you know what thats the answer sorry im not cheating but i have no inaudible  you did it manually you did it manually wow thats impressive i think this is the third one right i had more courage hm i dont know im just guessing you know but this is not gonna print oh whats the difference okay  so were halfway let me go to  oh okay why okay nevermind on the first one it lists one its inaudible  at least two okay okay yeah what is it im just reading the question thats fine i dont wanna know inaudible  not bad for guessing i got that wrong i didnt read that pass okay i think i downloaded this thing okay whats the activity that happens to me too what is the exercise  c right what is the name of the array thats what its called okay and what is the  yes but we cant call it name search though thats the method yeah okay this is where we write the names we could call it search but thats gonna be in the create a method so youre gonna add  there oh to create them youre just trying to add zero right i is less than  yeah i dont know if its inaudible  i dont think its open okay ill go with you okay im sorry okay i have to ask the names inaudible  okay thats good yeah so after that were gonna add then to the name that shouldnt be colon and names again right cool whatd you call it okay now its gonna say search but thats fine hm okay public static and were using string what is that name search isnt it the index yeah never mind yeah youre right inaudible  right there which thats well call this one so let me change that to s and then change that to m okay in the search a string in search what are we trying to do okay i have to go to that page  what little kid is acting up okay okay but that one went through  this one and then keep going over the rest now this one is jumping to the next one check with that one if its less both they trapped then jump to the next one no no look its going to but then it jumps to the next one no you jump to this one to that one check that one to that one check that one to that one and then you go down one  you see it right now its like theyre moving one number at a time then it goes down and do the same thing all over again but it starts from the four now i will no what im trying to say is that  no basically that one yes which is the six thats the key okay thats the bubble order how do you know its not optional for swap i think its the bubble or selection sort i think its the bubble look at the algorithm right here this is the algorithm for the bubble sort i dont  do you have the selection on your book so then we have to go  and this says swap here no im looking at the bubble i just want to see  you have selection there there should be the algorithm right no keep going i think you went too far selection okay it look like the bubble oh my goodness thats the okay so inaudible  why so the inaudible  go away okay on the whole inaudible  okay so three and five okay i know what to do so now theyre only going to check if five and two but then   yeah me too lets watch it can you maximize it im a little blind no thats fine okay so it starts on the first one then you swap again so now theyre going to start on that one thats what i was saying on that one it doesnt go that way thats the first one right well they did it here the first one thats the first one between one and zero so three and five right here they change one and then the rest it stays the same now here three five right now five and two then they switch to two and five right and then  that stays the same of course no thats two three now i thought we had to do the whole thing in the same way okay well lets go with you so now its one and two oh were talking about the inaudible  yeah look in the one zero and one yeah correct so zero one now here it says one and one i think theres a typo here okay so if were going that we just have to follow this thing so were checking the one and zero is one greater than five  i mean less i think its less five less than three no just those then one and two so now were checking one and two which is this and this and what you have on the zero the three that  its telling you which one to check one and zero so one is given and zero is this one in this case were checking this too zero and one and zero so one is five and three and zero is three well actually in this one because three is less than five then it goes into the case it goes to the first now on the second one were using this numbers here not the ones from the top in this one one and one i dont know why they have this here okay but thats the selection oh yeah yeah three two five eight okay three two five eight so this one right here two three five eight three two five eight yeah kind of i just it really looks like a selection like the selection when you have the one youre doing but im not sure so i cant argue lets do it like that lets continue if we have time we come back to that one you have the now i got confused here this is the inaudible  the selection do you see the swap looks like a selection dont have a heap or lurch i dont  that one looks like the   yeah im just checking see if this one  no it doesnt me neither i think its a selection that one is the algorithm its a inaudible  erase or just universe where are the whole group that should begin should go type the selection isnt this the one in the bubble or something no but i used selection because the other one is bubble i dont think theres going to be two this is the selection remember in the selection were using the class and the x j plus one and thats what were doing here and all the fours on the top and the other one we didnt use the selection done yeah because right here we have yeah that one goes like this we dont have to do that there right five three two eight seven and thats the erring inaudible  five and seven and six they did exactly same but they use different methods to do we can probably use them the same to do it what are the numbers inaudible  willing to do it on paper you know what time is it we dont have time inaudible  in this one is two twelve five then they stayed the same to the first yeah but i understand that part is that it goes through the whole inaudible  the first one you take the first one and then it compares to the second one and if its lower it stays the same if its higher they swap then the same thing with the same one again it goes to the first one you see the number one swap with the eight and the second one now were using the eight one and five as a reference to continue to the  until we get to the index five after we get to the index five then goes to the first loop and i dont know what we do in the first loop we do the thing all over again for the one two two five it stays the same yeah you see here thats the first one so now two right here the numbers in between five and two they swap those out but now two and five that stayed the same inaudible  me neither so all right five and three swap first and then three and two swap places no not inaudible  three and then five here right okay so now im confused right three and not move it either what is the key number so its going to be two three five seven eight nine no what happened with the six so what youre saying is seven eight nine and six again five seven eight nine and six five six seven nine thats it makes sense no its selection yeah well let everything right twentyone thirtyeight out of thirtynine its not that bad we can still try again though take the quiz again we got an incorrect all right three five  we got all inaudible  incorrect two three five seven nine nine six thats right all of them are the same but thats what it says which one which one oh inaudible  probably so this doesnt even have the answers probably because we have to retake it but where would that inaudible  then you see they dont check it every score right but its correct otherwise it would say its incorrect oh yeah what about in the  so we didnt get any points which one we fail though four  out of five yeah probably but we have all the numbers here so thats right the inaudible  which one nine yeah i wanted to choose this one so to begin with our middle one is three because theres no four inaudible  but nevermind we got it wrong then on this one we dont have it right the whole thing is wrong thats bad yeah thats right i know i think its something limits more do you think this is going to be   i dont think so because the lab is based on where we have like the most prework okay all right and then its time to line up nine pm which one right okay what does this say well keep the highest score all right click it then you know what we should have copied this but we already got this answers right thats not cheating nevermind well lets do it our computer froze i think because its old okay which  what is the first one search okay this is the binary less than linear for question three yeah the linear yes okay what is this three one why okay okay okay yeah one and then new variable which is in the circle inaudible  okay four i think its three first neighbor yes i was looking for the  okay it was three five again right yeah okay hold on then its two three five eight huh you disagree okay no you got that wrong right i mean  okay the first one is three two five eight right three two five eight okay three two oh okay this one comes from here right okay then  two three five eight now okay three five eight so again change now oh nevermind i got it okay thats the selection sort all of them inaudible  erase so let me see the textbook which page was it just inaudible  okay okay this is what well do were here from the first to that one and because this is shorter it goes to the first one thats what well do then it doesnt go to the last one then the second one to the second to last and then oh okay you know this is what it is five six seven so we have six we have seven how many do we have one two three four five six seven so it takes the first six numbers then if its lower it goes to the first and then they swap then weve got the one the second number then they compare that means if its lower it goes to the first and they swap and then the middles the middles swap if its lower they swap you see the middles but you still have to do this at the ends  seven eight then she said the line was supposed to be entered by the by the user  hold on let me hold on hold on im probably wrong no no no no no says define a two dimensional array event the inaudible  array in order to two value numbers crosstalk  okay so it is you find what do you use the or would you just declutter them i got a little confused  okay are you using yeah it does but it has to be inclusive so you need a plus one i think youre right i think youre fine because you have to no you need a one yeah no no because thats correct so this one should be three then and zero one and two and then it goes to seven so you get the highest when its the lowest which is two so now minus two equals seven and then plus two so what inaudible  two but you got some inaudible  in the nine  from two crosstalk  i gotta ask but why do you doing that are getting the length okay nevermind  mayarray im that im too slow to type so let me see what you have yeah thats what i was thinking i got an arrow loss oh yeah i forgot thank you it is working but we have to do it separately right no no no nevermind four i zero were starting in zero right  does it make any difference that we just roll or i its just a lane right what would you prefer what ever you like stop bother me just joking im just going to do it left okay so the next one is a column right i forgot how to spell column the different row goes with length one and the column goes with length two right my inaudible  yeah oh okay i think its working yeah i think i got confused now no but i just want to know if its right okay i dont know what im doing here  im writing things that are okay let me catch up main array row column for some reason im spelling column cou for some reason cause im doing it faster thats what i was thinking im not sure whether its eight or three but im not three right no okay because i know if it has to be inclusive it needs to be another plus  thats too much i still want to ask them i think im done oh i got to finish with this so why are you using this ill change that minus one nine plus one right and why its giving me oh its not my array just mainarray what so its going to be nine on top inclusive nine minus  is seven plus one which is ten so thats seven so thats fine the plus one makes it inclusive right okay so were good then she talks to us then like i learn something new every time she loves that i learn something new but when i have to read i didnt know that part i didnt know how to include it now i know what is he asking because i want to help i dont want to just copy so where are we so were here so calculate the average numbers crosstalk  okay lets print the array than okay we probably gonna have to change the last part right where two brackets down right no thats my but youre saying that i need to just the column though right right yeah now were using this one right here its painted the row and the column oh so its not printing the column okay i think im right right i think im yeah yeah i need one over here what oh yeah on to this but it is printing the array the min i and j together and then it goes on the next one oh lets try just yeah yeah thats what i was saying thats not that like that we just have to raise the line inaudible   they are they just have to because its a  yeah i ace plus well i been using that printer to print off thats why how its explain calculate the average numbers in each column of the min of range and assorted in some variable guess what data type should be its nit it should be nit  it can be in valuable too because you know it say print the average of columns the average dos not have to include they just have to the decimal point so it doesnt matter doesnt really matter we can use double but it doesnt need it doesnt matter or we can ask dont we have to create on the top first well doesnt really matter what are you doing but you have to create the number outside the variable something like that end average average its average but you read the average here i dont get how complicated this but oh that means and equal to zero right int average its also equal to zero now why are we using  which equal to zero so four nit by equal to zero i less than length two five plus plus inaudible  yeah were not using both of them but still were using them this yeah because yeah thats what i meant and sum plus plus right yeah and then outside will be okay so im good okay what now one of this or main array main array no i knew i was wrong sum equals main array  zero and the nine  then outside right were gonna do the average  dont we have to print it oh okay  sum divided by three thats what right sum divided by length two we dont even need the average i guess we can i guess i can do like this look right just equal i mean average i just like to test it before i do something else but you right you have to do something so let me write here the average of ten what happened for each column so i guess youre talking about the elements right or the indexes thats youre confused right but they want it separate or just one column and then we print so were doing this two at the same time right okay so lets do that  the first part right and the first part right so youre doing that one okay okay just a description okay thank you thats good to know oh my goodness right here length one this is one and this is two thats what i was doing thats what i was doing column equals zero you know i found another apollo on the computer its every time i type something it types once so i think its breaking down so inside yeah i think okay let me see i think i got an arrow here okay wait  okay lets cross our fingers inaudible  plus one plus four plus nine zero five four  yeah thats the inaudible  i need use some data right do you read that part theres some things here for inaudible  calculate the average you need to we got that you need to use length method okay but it says it doesnt matter doesnt have to include digits after the decimal point it doesnt have to but we can do it look it can be  or  so were good dont they need the number this for example i got one two three and four  so the average is lets use one two and three its easy one two and three plus three is six so the average divided by three is shoot yeah two so what is the maximum value after two is three thats the value look seven seven so they oh okay  times four times lets before we go oh yeah because divided by two is seven i think they want it in methods okay so lets no we its easy the first one on the second column were gonna use one or not actually zero but the index on the first one the i on whatever it is we cant use zero because the array is under for the first one but not for the second one but how do you know yes my thing is im questioning the zero it shouldnt be zero it should be i okay so ill shut up so it makes you one if the loops right it can probably use column can we use the length instead of the row the length one right one and two it should be column it should be i im trying to think of the other way because the column is length so its not the length because like for example the length is four so its always going to be four right i think its the same thing i think so because they do it just for one column  how do we get  yes but then if you wanna get can we do it in a method and bring it to okay where are we bringing the sum and the average  so hold on inaudible  are we bringing the average  but not inside the parameters right yeah well bring it out  oh i know what it is  bringing them down inside right okay nope too much work im lazy lane array just to put something right here okay inaudible  im using your words so dont accuse me of plagiarism  youre calling that a column okay thats probably why im having a problem all right why re we doing this i forgot what we were doing sorry i got to be okay so i think im good i think im missing one of the this  again i got a problem thats probably because of the crosstalk  yeah yeah yeah  oh my computer froze after the print yeah im thinking that okay i will return that sure there isnt the main array why are we using length two no but why dont we use line one okay the average is gonna be now nine too right here right yeah sorry okay okay yeah do you think thats easier do we have to we just have to wait then we have to comment but we dont have to put the description or the inaudible   okay so okay lets call them average in order right oh my god my nose it didnt work thats fine lets try with the calculator hold on dont do anything give me the numbers for the first column two five im not yet inaudible  im still writing down okay lets try the resource yeah yes im not sure inaudible  here okay hold on divided by thats not bad its good okay lets go back to the column it should be this is printed right because this is divided by another four add it again thats weird and you got an error nine twelve yeah thats not what i have because the average of  is not three  but the index goes outside right lets ask cause i think were getting were almost there every body busy and then we got an error no but length two is rogue lets see five six     divided by four five five seven by what is that okay lets see on mine on long because i have what you find no its not three oh yeah  a four loop but now you gonna use i i was counting eighth columns its not counting the last one two thats not counting two the last two why are we putting minus one oh okay i think so because were just using i dont think its make it work it says its out of bounds that i dont understand why because the length is just we just using that as a how to stop it were not using it inside and you got one two three four five six seven but hes gonna give you a inaudible   inaudible  not really right minus one probably but yeah you changed these were probably gonna need help  what is it shes coming its giving us an error out of bounds error really help a lot so you using the i instead of the index and then outside should be less now hes three it doesnt say they wanted to input them earlier it doesnt say we need to ask for the numbers the second part but they have to be asking in the method right and then they pull up to the main right now this one gets twodimension now the method goes down wasnt it the th ah screw it its because i got to turn in something else that day okay so are we creating the method first or what the first one inaudible  getarray its the end right and were getting something from the main and one we get the number as input okay so lets use n for simplicity the first one is the row right what oh okay can we just ask the same question for the  instead of two questions yeah im just saying yeah thats fine input that im behind so go ahead okay sixteen stepping twice okay what are we calling the allay  okay the numbers on display randomly display right no right here it says it doesnt say and thats for the second inaudible  im going to keep calling it rose its not rose its a number inaudible  when i use are you using the brackets at the end of the loop have some have you learned some methods crosstalk  no no no youre fine but in the books some of the exercises have those crosstalk  well right now youre using cones or well im using ice and whatever i just got used to the things i used to have to inaudible  i forgot something let me just remember something why are you using n in there right okay so i dont know whats going on today im just going to use column its probably because ive been doing this since yesterday they are creating random numbers charge estimate hmm what is it yeah yeah inaudible  one point at separate point that printed la there yeah and then to  yeah that should give you the measurement and whatever its called how many did you get where inaudible  oh okay never mind okay input  which one yes we can uh i would understand that but if you make i guess run it that way how many inaudible  you could have used two and three yeah yeah i see what youre saying so that will not create in the area outside no just in numbers well i just got two i mean three and we dont need this anymore then what one we dont need to print yeah im a little behind so hold on oh yeah then i know what it is and i was going to ask you something else but yeah thats fine okay ive got a problem here oh i know what it is input its giving me an arrow i think i need i dont that anymore i do need it mmhmm affirmative it fixed that i just dont have the return so its after the second right that i need to do a turn here and then so system no im sorry four  its not going to work either because we need the length for the array right where is the length why dont we just do thats what i was going to say but its just you know we only have to move one more for me its only one huh why are you taking everything but you cant get the numbers of the length from above but that doesnt go outside okay go ahead let me see so youre seeing the one that creates the array the c  array youre bringing it up to so what are you using the method for thats what they want you find the method which creates a twodimensional array so wed have to create the array inside the method and then bring it up the user sets the size of array net the returns the twodimension array you see to the main but we dont have to display yet what if we do everything for the second one inside the method then we just get the answer we could do that can we do that but wed have crosstalk  we can have to calculate the average right but there might be a way to do thats what were doing right now this time i read the whole thing i just dont remember my head is kind of you see here they just get the answer now its the sum look thats what they get so for this one you see mt  array they do the whole thing and then just leave it up rich or m but what is m because you inaudible  no inaudible  are you using that or theyre not returning they were returning m and how they declared it here is they dont have anything else its just that and they get the number inside the method so thats all you got in the main youre not having inaudible  you get all the numbers and the inaudible  but youre having no problem crosstalk  uhhuh yeah ive saving you from the pain three columns you got it im always behind the only thing that i see is youve got the numbers in the main yeah i know what youre doing its just that i think i understood something else but thats fine im not going to complain thats not my problem  minutes away of analyzing days and then another hour doing something else that you dont even know what i was doing yesterday since i left you which you just texted me i was in class then i left from there to  i was working on that thing because i already submitted i had it but i was still working then i just got tired huh yeah but that should be easy then im doing that so i just dont know where i am i think im okay ive got the numbers thats the array so i need to create the array here right to create the array or to fill up the array im just a little slow today no that goes to the method oh okay i think i got the method no oh here this one right here right how do you have it m i dont know why but they put those question marks out i dont know if that makes a difference i just see that in the book they do it all over again okay and right here is giving me an error i dont know why here i dont need this anymore right let me try to get the numbers oh no never mind thats all i have why are you putting in two arrays im going to put this down when you say any more inaudible  im holding you down right sure let me see if it works on mine now i was just two and three okay all right good okay are we bringing down the array again or no average right inaudible  what are we going to call it m i thought we were going to pull this one i think so but were not done yet okay we also need a method right i mean four loop on that one i want to follow you because you have that okay you pulled l what are you doing there oh you should tell me go back to your computer and start typing how did we get the length but you dont have the array im sorry im not trying to what is that are you putting the whole thing in the name and you called it inaudible  array okay i was like never do that i dont know if you do it like that so lets say eight and one im just trying to catch up with you no no no go ahead its just me today im a little slow i dont know all right thats that one i think mine is called m oh never mind let me see j plus plus okay what are we doing for this sum first did you declare sum in the top okay you can go with me later where were we turning youre going to set it close to zero we dont need it right okay so right there thats the other right into average make it bigger so i can divided by how you make plan oh okay were doing different things i understand what youre saying im sorry its just ive been using length whatever thing its called bad length or inaudible  but i know what it is what dont worry about that theyll use it yeah go ahead because i think i was going to get a crosstalk  what problem do you have i dont have a problem though so you should what is the name of it the average right i got average but ill change it to get average were just going to print it right now what did you bring down the m what do you mean both ns yeah thats what i was saying it worked did it work for me it didnt thats for the whole array right okay lets make a calculation while youre waiting thats okay uh i got an error i think its right here right it should inaudible  now okay one and two inaudible  its still giving me an error lets see if i choose three and four or two and three one two three four five six its here thats fine right got the arrow were showing average that looks fine sum is here now here ive got get average m hold on ive got i dont have anything yeah thats the array so i should erase this right here one two so you have an arrow right there ive got n ive got n and i have n right here is  m right here thats fine right okay the sum equals m i j and ive got brackets so thats fine oh that was a good catch all right thank you very much i should have stayed there oh we have another one he said not to put comments oh yeah yeah yeah the average of array is whatever okay well its basically the same thing inaudible  we had to look for the number where does it say that  yeah thats fine okay lets do it for me ive got to be careful yeah i will lose it okay character search thats what im going to call mine oh my goodness copying the whole thing yeah i think its working the first one worked and now were working on the second problem yeah weve got that i think its something ive got to change that right now no but i might have later search okay lets do that dont waste time were going to use some i dont think we have to use unicode no theres another way an easier way i just dont remember how okay lets do it lets not waste time because right now i cant think but we need to put in the numbers the user has to put in the numbers for the array inaudible  yeah thats right pull out the arrays with the letters im thinking about how to do that input because i did that the other day i was practicing with characters and you have to cast it but i just how do you call your array again im going to call it matrix uh no then weve got the n n okay theyre already there okay you already created them im not even late then so that i can public static what are you using the tron getarray okay  okay its fine thats fine with me m equals and that goes getarray we need numbers from hold on i cant even use this lets use unicode then because were going to have problems there it is in the book i just dont remember where can you get it it should be in chapter  i think eight no you look in seven ill look over this way i just want to see look i think its like this like that or not no its end less or equal is here theyre using how do you print system i got block by now for what i just want to show you the characters first weve got pi right but i got to inaudible  so well get that hold on hold on i cant do that but let me just remember because inaudible  and charts work together they work the same i think youd have to or  im not sure if its centered thats for the other one you see random its the same method okay so im little bit with you right so well  i right calling inaudible  for you right i is less or equals in this case well on that part im going to follow you led us on n n right plus plus because im crazy im a little cuckoo today okay we havent the credit oh yeah we do so were going to fill the array right ive called it inaudible  yeah i j equals  or char yeah wed have to okay lets do char like youre doing it except i think we have to cast the whole thing but left dot z it should be z y minus a yeah i think its int no okay so z equal inside a parentheses okay so z minus a plus one lies minus one okay lets try that ive never done this before i just steer the way inaudible  right okay that should work no thats not work no youve had the return i would return the matrix i mean the array yeah i think just to make sure that its the array oh yeah yeah no no i have another one but we already called it right here oh never mind  oh yeah thats where it is we have to run it so again for i right it worked hm oh we have to print it okay its probably that hold on let me finish with this no thats funny though let me see if mine works you keep using those numbers too big how about this okay this is random never mind it didnt work for me okay i dont want to use this you did it okay so i erased the whole thing so let me copy yours because im crazy i dont know what i did right here about me thank you for that okay  thats it just to be safe i dont think we need that one but thats fine okay  okay but were not getting eight were not getting eight i mean youre inaudible  either so lets take crosstalk  yeah lets talk about this i dont think we need one were at z minus a plus a where do i need to put this i think here crosstalk  like this probably okay i got a whole bunch of things here i got all inaudible  but i still have that thing you dont erase that one so okay  i still get those one things i dont know oh its minus  no yeah that makes sense im trying to remember what i did because whats half of z i have a question were trying to get random characters but were not getting the z and i dont know if were going to arrive at one  right there if a should crosstalk  zero no but i dont get the a the a is not there b is there but not the a i got the b before b is right here but not the a no because then crosstalk  what if we erase this one just keep the a would that be a oh inaudible  i changed that i just raised that thing but i inaudible  i erased the a im still not getting the a yeah that could work that works because okay you recite it oh okay i dont know the vowels cause i was just trying to doesnt matter what the name is right can we create a loop how do we that one no i mean because we dont know right how to set out so like probably another loop or a while i think that will supplement ugh the random number is index right nine is inclusive or exclusive you had it yeah i was thinking about the if like how do you set that and i think so but i wanna evaluate the total type of evac without looking at it what are they let me catch up okay assign matrix so you got it the thing i told you it got it what is the parameters for the matrix after the random cancel okay hold on so i index right is equal one huh you think its its probably because theres no ending what is the when you put the next line here okay so then print really oh yes to do it like this but you can actually use a higher gain i am tempted laughs i dont have time to and that should be the length of what of the columns right yeah youre right so rows is five and five plus four on both of them or just the first two column okay to print oh no so that was the first part right now my computer is not working right there right huh yeah i think so i meant to do that right here okay uh you can tell im not here today right inaudible  i need to do the date too do i need to put it at the input in the back line whatever i need so everything else like this right here because i used five inaudible   all right that should work yeah but it only has one here or does random but yours starts from the third right but it doesnt matter okay well thats how yours okay thats gonna go right down here right right at the end okay what does the loop do create a loop nine times like this right but then we create the if statement goes inside the loop right oh you need a connor tree  youre not returning that valid right its just whether they ring or not okay thats okay four on the matrix it starts at zero zero zero right or the i i im sorry i j then its true otherwise its false oh im sorry then what key goes to true nice okay and it needs the um why its giving me an array thats how this works right which is right here that should be an if statement if key is equal to the other so if key is true then they win so if this is turned off try not to take your time i guess i lost no i lost i tried it has to give me a win otherwise okay so how do i know i win im not convinced im not convinced sounds good i cant lose all the time oh hey whats the purpose of this program what yeah but what is the purpose how do we win oh okay so thats how that i lose all the time so its okay okay and thats it we can go home good im just commenting yeah wait what you been doing we do not have to it lets see the description im putting the submission first sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt just oh i dont even know whether its saved uhoh mmhmm affirmative me neither what i cant do the exit form it just wont allow me these are supposed to be helpful okay not probably should i switch okay uh well probably have to call him hm oh okay okay be right back can i have inaudible  shes planning i dont know oh sorry im back alone

that should be good all right so they need to choose either one yeah so the menu is there if one then they want square so were going to do  we ask them for the dimensions of the square so what yeah so ask them whats the length of the side yeah so were only going to ask them for one side then were going to store that lets call it x then it prints what the output is this ones for the square were still on the square right so two is for the rectangle so lets do that one next whats the length of the side no im just showing crosstalk  right its showing the method right exactly so this is behind the scenes if that makes sense so then we ask them for two variables for the length and the width of the rectangle thats okay im just sketching it quickly so that we can program it if triangle  so this is if they said square yeah i think thats a switch statement right there youre putting in more detail than i am well so we need to map out what each method would look like next yeah so write four methods to get dimensions of each shape yeah lets just do it on the page so triangle and a circle im just thinking i guess we need to use double right we need to use double or integer no double yeah all right are you ready all right yeah you have to connect them right so this one goes here this one also goes here this one goes here this one goes here you did so lets try thats okay so we want to do a new class is it working this is activity  wow weve come a long way before you create it make sure that you dont have any of these checked because when youre creating your own method you dont want to have this pretty sure it says write four methods to get dimensions for each shape right well its a combination of them but lets just try it that ill make a new crosstalk  sure i think so yeah ill just write it in and do it like this first we want to write a switch statement right no first we want to start the scanner now weve got to give them the menu options right yeah so menu options are choose square rectangle triangle and  what was the last one circle hm oh sure we could all right well do that later then so then we want to store the input so its a string right so it said in the guidelines to do it that way yeah youre right let me reread that instruction user input can be either an uppercase or lowercase or mixed that means we cant use a switch or we could convert it once they yeah i think youre right yep so lets do that so string input equals  just to get  so weve asked them to enter their options so we need to store what they answer we dont know it could be anything theyll type it in though theyll type in the word square or the word rectangle and it might be uppercase i didnt put one i just put square no its string input dot next line equals square yeah that works square but we need to also do  theres a different method that we need its not just equals its like regardless of whether its a uppercase or lowercase we want it to do this its not two uppercase or two lowercase equals ignore case  thats what we want we want that one equals ignore case choice dot equals ignore case can you remind me again is it capitalized wait its not working is that in quotations oh sorry ive forgotten these wait no its not working its not there should be something before it though usually its something dot equals isnt it well why dont we try both have them both there i got it its this one so you have choice dot equals ignore case no dot and then choice in parentheses thats good if it equals  what so this cant be choice anymore it needs to be  square yeah yeah i think it does so then if theyve chosen square we need to print whats the length of the side yeah is it going to work if we dont start the scanner over again lets try it length equals input dot next double no i thought so but it doesnt need it yeah all right so now weve got that number oh sorry why ill just say side then hows that side or sides so now we want to do square  this is where we need to put the method in well we need to write a method yeah the calculation is for a square right so a square is just the beginning we say we want it to be a double do what right here thats calling the method but we need to create the method below so that itll print that right no so now we need to do the calculation for a square which is  its all right double area equals side times side right return area im confused let me see i think its all good but there might be something wrong we might need to call it x instead of side is that okay all right so were trying to  yeah youre right its probably because it needs to be a variant of  it could be all right which one this one up here i think it should be here and that there should also be a line that says print it right this should be side area right i have no idea yeah right so it should just be the method signature is that what you mean so well just say square no i did something wrong what do you think double result equals square and side square side oh you want me to change it so this stored the variable then this is the method thats supposed to create the area of the square right does everything in this look good double area equals  oh maybe i need parentheses around this oh it did that helped i dont know why also why is there double result should we make it result instead of area it shouldnt matter what we name it you have to have a return this should really be double area right or is it result then this could be side doesnt matter what we do here do you think its because were using words instead of numbers its not thinking of this as a number somehow put it in parentheses no it shouldnt matter oh maybe its because i have a bracket in the wrong spot oh i took out a bracket and that helped were going to need it to open no i think the whole method needs to go at the bottom thats the wrong  no it need to be way at the bottom i think yeah there we go perfect i think thatll work should we try it really we wont get anything right now because its kind of unfinished right yeah cant start it oh okay square no didnt work we dont have a loop we need to have a loop right this needs to be looping yeah im just kind of talking i guess oh this needs to be in a print statement thats why oh there its got a system lets just do print that might do it yes it did it all right what do you mean oh sure thats a good idea ill change this math dot the side im just going to delete this oh youre right it needs another the formula for a square is the side times the side so if they enter  oh youre right ill stop talking no thats good i like your idea oh its where you have square there it should be square side yeah yep right there too because theyre calling the method there oh so theres two different things here right theres square which is the name of the method theres square side which is what youve called the input so actually that one needs to be square that one needs to be square crosstalk  oh its probably just the brackets add a bracket here a close bracket i mean brace closed just get rid of that then get rid of one down here there we go awesome so now we need to do a different if statement so this part at the bottom is just the method so in terms of our ifs we still need to put the three other options in between here yeah do you think after that brace there  so its another if right so if choice dot crosstalk  rectangle and then open brackets open braces wait you dont want that thats good then its the exact same thing basically we could just use that yeah oops well repeat this exact thing just change it from length of side to length of side and length of width right yeah we need to store two variables thats all right i get it wait wait wait youre ahead of me were not done yet are we which leg so again lets just put a method right here just like this one and put it right after this so basically were stashing a new method at the bottom right no outside of it just its own unit yeah one is closing your if statement and the other one is closing the crosstalk  i think yeah thats good but we need to change the name rectangle the whole side yeah its going to do that for a little while because we need to build the method yep this is just length times width are you getting an error whatd i do it must be too many brackets its probably my brackets how many do you have ill get rid of that one and this one double result equals rectangle and then length width then  you have to print it right thats not working whatd i do put what right here oh its not applicable its double double i guess i didnt oh youre right down there oh thats a good catch that helped all right yeah now weve got to do triangle so another if well it might be different this time ill try yeah looks good mmhmm affirmative height and base the base has to be smaller than the height right no then thats fine just shows how much math i know it shows how much math i know we need to write this method we need to write the method for it well its going to do different things but it starts out similar just below it yeah mmhmm affirmative im getting errors yeah this is good no ive got a lot of problems i think its because of my brackets whats the formula for the triangle all of it divided by two ill try that this is going to need another one on the side just so its enclosed crosstalk  no i still got an error up here its another one maybe whatd i do up here double base double height thats good right base cannot be resolved to a variable oh i think i forgot to declare it up here oh see its right here this should say base and height but it doesnt hang on last one we have this circle enter a number for the radius we still have the audio yeah but she said raise your hand if you have it oh well is it working number four thank you no i dont see anything guess we dont have to do anything yeah i know im kidding do you think we just need to refresh its down here somewhere probably there it is all right yep good all right lets just read through it develop string method we need to develop a program that gets a string and counts the number of vowels in the string write step by step pseudocode for this program have it as the block comma to your code all right so thats the first step then draw the flow chart then develop the program so you want to open a program and well just write the pseudocode activity  this time well call it question one thats okay all right new class oh are we supposed to oh okay pseudocode version why do you have an asterisk its just happening all right so we need to use a scanner to get a string right yeah yeah lets call it sentence hows that im just doing that we dont need to then i think the only other thing before we make methods would be call the vowelfind method right find vowel method count vowels is there two steps in there i think we should put that in a method so in this portion we should say just call the method well just say call method which counts vowels hows that now we have to write the method so then begin method yeah yeah begin method we need to explain what the parameters are i guess its a string right crosstalk  do you want it to be a void method or a valuereturning method all right so begin a method which   takes in a string and counts the vowels all right then i would say do a loop that checks the index of each  the character h index start loop yeah all right good enough right all right do you feel ready to do a program oh we need a flowchart were not oh return number of vowels return the number of vowels yeah all right so crosstalk  extra paper lets use some of this if you have a pen oh i dont know here thank you fancy its hard to write it starts with the oval right no hold on thanks here hows that oh the instructions theyre right here all right the first thing is to take in the sentence so prompt the user for a sentence so type a sentence that is in a statement then we just need to store it lets call it s for simplicitys sake sc s okay s equals input all right i feel like its more useful to look at our pseudocode here so prompt user to enter a sentence call the method how do you do a flowchart i dont think there were any flowcharts the method is down here so we really just need to call it so lets call it vowel count hows that not yet no maybe not is it still plugged in then well write the method down here right thats the name of the method yeah and thats where its going to yeah well i made a counter i think so its part of the method well so theyre not going to be connected because this is really just connected by an invisible line so this is the signature for the method right so if you crosstalk  youre calling this method but theyre not physically connected yeah oh okay lets do that should we just turn it off while were taking the quiz while we take the quiz should we just turn it off as long as we dont talk while were taking the quiz its good i cant see i cant read that far i wouldnt have known is it how many different methods or i thought it was six got like a zero okay so lets quickly write this method and then we can code it do you want to use a four or a while while actually in the flow chart i guess it doesnt really matter huh cause were basically saying as long as the counter yeah less than length well just connect these to yourselves length yeah ill wait if you wanna i put counter because were counting something later on and i dont want to get confused you got it yep and then im saying if yes were gonna have to do a really big no we need to get the si whatever its called for all vowels so in the flow chart maybe we can just write as long as its either a or i or u cause were trying to find all of the vowels were gonna need two because we need to say while the index yeah its gonna be a loop i think theres a couple of steps here so lets make a new counter and call it x so this loop here is kind of like the large wild loop and we wanna make some smaller loops inside right so heres a smaller counter that we can use for this next loop if the character at the index of well we dont mean the index we mean the character at the index of right so were going to do char at and this one would be x equals  well just put the vowels for now well figure the code out later and y maybe theres a debate about y so if it does equal this then we want to increase the counter right we need a new counter then because were using this counter for this loop and were using this counter for this one this is the method you mean easier to do this first yeah lets just say number of vowels equals  something like that number of vowels plus plus no i dont think so yeah so well say if it gets to here make the vowels bigger hows that so this is yes well make no coming off this way i guess like in an l or something program youre right yeah youre right i think we need to say thats it theres a problem with this cause right now it would do it once so we need to make x bigger here x plus plus yeah but we need to make sure that x goes one higher next time so that its checking the index after that but make sure youre making x bigger too no thats a different thing thats the number of vowels alright that should do it so how do we  im lost if this isnt okay this will read the first character in the sentence and if its an a or an i or an o or an e or a u it will then make the counter go up one yeah do we okay then lets not lets just try and code it do this again do you wanna just stack those here for a minute or ill put it here so you can see it while you code the flowchart so im just gonna start by importing the scanner did he do it already did he finish it already okay string s equals input dot line yeah lets just  well i mean its not gonna actually do anything yet but  might just have to put s in there like the name of the method and then vowel count yeah yeah and you might want to capitalize count  so now lets try to figure out the method we can fix that part later oh yeah string s and then open braces i dont think so so now i think we need to declare the counter mmhmm affirmative i feel worried about lets just keep trying and see if it comes out im not sure first lets get the length okay thats what i got to now we need the while while counter is less than length is it less than or equal to or is it just less or equal okay im changing that and then dont forget to open braces but we dont want it to cause it starts from zero right so lets do not equals well find out later when we test it yep and now lets declare x yeah cause were gonna start a new loop this is where we need to get the astii codes for these letters yeah do you have that sheet or should i look it up should write that down somewhere there we go so we need lower case  oh shoot we need it regardless of case ignore case yeah but we need to be able to do x slash u and then the number that it has to do with it so lets take the range of capital a to we only want vowels though so were gonna need specific cant we do a statement thats like if the character at the index of one is a or is i or is u it doesnt sound fun but i feel like its the only way like a bowlian  variable sounds good lets do that cause it will be too long well call it bowlian is vowel hows that its inside the first loop i dont think it really matters as long as its high enough up that its not to late whats the number for a lowercase maybe i dont know maybe not i want the next value so i e  and okay and f we havent gotten to those questions yet so lets not worry  wait a minute this is capitals do we have to do another one for oh so we need to do another one for capitals right i guess we cant do that i dont think so what am i supposed to be doing we dont yet we want to check i dont think so yeah this is definitely a new loop here and this is a loop but then this is a loop if the character at index of zero dot char at just put x did you declare an x i would put that back in there and x declare x well if char at x is equal to  and then we need all of the vowels let me try and paste this in and see if this part works down there cause thats really what you need right here it works so i dont think we can declare it up here no you know what now it doesnt work now that i got rid of that so we cant u  great so i probably should just not have these parenthesis what else did i do wrong here cause the or is not working make that the whole hand thats a good idea so lets copy this whole part bowlian is vowel  this probably needs to be in parenthesis again yeah this isnt working oh are we supposed to say is equal to what theres an error x in error cause ive got my x higher up and its still not working i think we need to do i know what we should do we should do this call it yeah can we convert it into an integer by doing this look you can convert it into an integer cause then it might be allowed to be in here like if you say equals  no i dont know maybe this needs more parentheses oh i see that makes sense okay so wait what kind of variable is it i thought it was a character sorry character okay wait ch equals schar x but this is going to need to be in the method no this isnt good i think youre on to something i just need to  let me organize here there you go that works i just moved the x to higher up and so this ones working now i think thats good x is whats going into this and put it higher up okay and then create this character yeah thats good right there yeah yeah and then put x and then parentheses there lets see oh yeah i dont remember what im doing here its late okay ch equals these hm inaudible  oh six nine and six f yeah six nine  sorry six f okay and dont forget theres a zero before the six and then  okay now this has to be like or ch lets see if i get any errors yep nice thats awesome okay crosstalk  an if wait what i had while this should be if hang on okay and then we really dont need anything else right we do wait okay so if this is true we need to make the number vowels variable go up but we havent declared it yet so before the x equals zero put a number of vowels integer no its this whole new thing right so vowel counts is the name of our method so we cant use that one number of vowels i wonder why im having an error up here now oh i think it the brackets theres not enough of them hm number of vowels can equal zero and then  great well worry about it in a sec first lets  yeah so return    wait first we need to make number of vowels go up and then we need to return it return we cant do it in two steps yeah oh the method must return a result of type integer it is why are they they already are so weve said if this character happens to be a vowel but then make this number higher right so that should be good but we might need an else because its not that then what is it going to return right so we need to put else return with nothing right can we do that just return nothing i think we forgot to make the counter change because the counter needs to get bigger now right counter plus plus that fixed it crosstalk  yeah okay well because of the big loop the bigger loop needs to change right oh you were on number one oh youre right theres only one no okay see this is going to keep running for forever because the counter hasnt changed okay crosstalk  oh maybe we take this off crosstalk  well finish it later right fourteen no were not done yeah okay okay yeah i know now i mean yeah i think this needs to be  i dont know there crosstalk  okay we need to show the value and its index so lets print it here yeah yeah im still getting the zeroes this is bad i dont know youre getting numbers okay yes no yours is good very good mmhmm affirmative i do oh okay let me try that there its working but it should only show the max its not working this ones working oh no alright so the answer to that is that this needs to be outside of the inaudible  right lets try that six is the max well i printed over here hang on crosstalk  source i and then put that on the outside right okay lets try that oh wait i said nine one two three four five six seven nine ten ah inaudible  oh and i think this needs to be minus one inaudible  no that was just the max printing right wait a minute          yeah its working i just didnt lets try it this way cant do that okay lets try the five there we go yeah you want to write these two yeah ill think about the next one its kind of like setting the maximum to zero and its for the first index does that help i dont think it works without the zero do you want me to test it okay they want us to show the value and the index so we need to change this to not just show  for this loop you only want to run until it finds the final answer and then you want it to print the answer after the fact but for this one you want it to print every time it loops doe that help i tried that it didnt work yeah cool i have a question is it better to use one loop and do everything in one loop or do you need separate loops for each like abcd or does it depend oh how do i close    there alright sorry about that okay cause weve got the you know this is basically answering a can we in theory use that same loop to do some of thspeaker  okay crosstalk  alright okay but it wouldnt work if you just started doing the things in the same loop like just put right in there the something that answers that thanks crosstalk  okay yeah lets not do that we cant do that im just copying this first loop so that we can work faster now how do i change this though cause we dont want that right we want something else to happen okay okay alright ive made some empty loops here okay so in this one we want to add  crosstalk  oh it doesnt seem to care yeah youre right lets use a different one lets use k what should we use for the fourth loop okay oh yours is working okay alright great thats fine alright okay inaudible  yeah i think so alright enter number in the print line you did the new line but you didnt say max put max in there crosstalk  oh are we supposed to do from ten to a hundred i thought we were doing from  oh shoot i need to change that okay okay why does the line have to be so large we definitely shouldnt print it because that would be to long im taking that line out i dont want to print it anymore im gonna print the maximum let me try its working oh max equals source you need to decore max before you use it in that if statement wait no thats not right it looks the same as mine doesnt it thats so weird and theres no restates yeah try again there you go alright yeah im intimidating so if you can make some of those empty loops so that we can work with them i dont know oh yeah we finished b were on c now the next loop yeah so theres two steps in making the average first we need to get the total of all the numbers added together and then divide it by how many numbers there are right so this loop will get us the total and then well divide it yeah im calling it inch though because we dont have any doubles is it still recording yeah okay okay yeah i put it before the loop and then we only really need one line in the loop so that it adds every number up to  yeah but that would have to be outside the loop right cause we need to get all of the numbers together and then go outside the loop to do the average yeah sorry all the numbers no way crosstalk  oh thats not a semicolon its a colon there you go crosstalk  yeah no the average oh i did one line before that to get the average here yeah well crosstalk  no cause the loop inside is doing things repetitively and we only want it to do one thing yeah youre doing good well im worried because total and n are both integers so if we dont tell it that we want the division to do like precise things dont you think wed need to so the numbers are   and three and three the average is  well why dont we have it print  okay let me test it and see how it goes oh i gotta do my new line going here cause that looks really bad im gonna swap where the new line goes crosstalk  its because you write j twice oh no its working thats awesome nice looks good alright so now were on d find the elements that have a higher values than average value inaudible  yeah lets use  inaudible  yeah were just doing that one right so lets just start another loop this is where i dont know i think what you want to do is an if inside here that says if this number whatever it is is  yeah greater than average and we might need to inaudible  declare the average so that average up here and now weve got it in a loop so we need to just pull it through somehow dont we inaudible  oh okay so if its higher we want to send it into a new array which means we need to declare a new array so lets declare it up here what should we call it high values oh okay this isnt  okay this isnt the right way to do this its like that right okay hows that yeah oh right wait i cant quite read that the same type and size so lets make it a size up here too lets say inch cant we say its n because they told us the size is gonna be n for this loop you need to create a new la with the same type and size of source array so its gotta be the same size so now what goes in there i dont know imagine this number is bigger than average we need to make a new variable or put it into that one so how do you put it into it like high values l yeah thats it that makes sense but we need it to keep doing that really sorry im distracted can we use this one because were copying it into it so maybe in this part instead of doing that whole step we could do it in baby steps like here just store the values somehow okay can we say do you think that would work okay i gotta print it way down here i think yeah okay what do i have crosstalk  again thats why were a team right actually that might be too far out of the loop let me try it a little bit farther up i dont know if this is gonna work out the average is  and then this is printing what every single number right thats not what we want we only want it to print if its larger than oh so i do need to take it lower down i think we actually might want  no its something about the l well i cant well this needs to be  oh we cant print it at all because we have to print an array which means we have to have another loop yeah how do you do a printing loop again i gotta remember displaying arrays we need to use this entire loop to print so lets do that you are useful yeah did you use k though okay oh this is still not working because i cant print l i have to print b okay im gonna try this just to see if its working okay its not working oh actually it is nevermind wait the average is six so it only printed things that are higher than six i think thats because we didnt put anything in those values like in those indexes its just they just feel it to zero error oh the array yeah this is the high values array you can see none of the numbers are smaller than six unless you count the zeros i think the zeros are just placeholders shuffle random shuffling thats our next step yeah right here it looks hard it looks hard i think this part is kind of like the  remember the th value to swap the places of two its just the same exact thing okay im gonna put a comment in for each loop so that we can remember what were doing whoops sorry yeah did you already do  yeah right here this is to print the array but you dont have to do that it didnt say to like you could not do any of that and youd be fine youre good so instead lets do a new loop with m yeah two down yeah yeah thats good right yeah thats the one thats basically what i wrote so  now im noticing something this is not okay its gonna go too far oops so lets do minus one hows that and then this one source yeah so that we can randomly shuffle it based on a random number do we need to  i think this since it has two loops kind of you need two different variables so im gonna use m and then im gonna change this one to no we cant use n weve already used n lets say s okay so s is our no it wont let us do that oh i dont know its got an error oh why would they want me to have that there wait im here int yeah no so i dont need the bracket i just need that thats alright good yeah which is s right now im still using m okay so this little piece here is like the equivalent of us calling a variable like x right and this is the equivalent of y so i made a temporary variable and i set it to x now im setting x to y and then ill set y to the temp and that will have swapped the places of those two numbers but since theyre actually calling parts of an array were just switching two numbers in two different arrays in one array right in one array and we dont know which two numbers because its a random number called s were not shuffling the index were only shuffling the numbers that are at those places right thats not right though its giving me an error i think its because i used double and these numbers are actually integers yeah thats it im just making a note so i dont forget why we did this because im very close to that point to forget why im doing these things okay so thats  wait lets go back i dont think so okay are we on f yeah this is gonna be hard what are we gonna call it oh target so first lets just name it baby steps right so im going outside of that loop i think so inaudible  okay lets name this one int target wait i thought we had to name it target okay alright so thats created yeah because it said it needs to be the same size okay now copy the first half of the source array into the second half alright shifting elements we might need to use this why i see cant we just  we can do divided by n because n is our length of okay so yeah yeah youre right wait no no thats not right well lets make a loop and well have to use what like q now ive already used i ive already used i really oh i feel silly now okay yeah okay now its not working i think we need new ones oh okay gotcha alright so now we have a loop and weve got a new array so we want to make sure to put youre right hows this look to you if we put it right in there this thing will only loop as much as half the length so and then if we set this to start at  and wait yeah it is target is set to n right so this is the equivalent of n divided by two so is that good alright but we dont want it to put this into the first half so were gonna have to set this instead of to zero  wait no i think its nested loops oh what if you did  if q greater crosstalk  what if we set it to the same thing like can we do this okay and n we want to put them into it so well say the new thing into the old thing right so target cant type and this is q source not q i feel like it should be q wait so are we supposed to print it they must want us to print it im gonna take this print thing and change it to fit i am printing it but i think we have to have a new loop to do that so instead of high values we want this to be target oh let me see if it works no it was close but its not right mmhmm negative so look you can only put them into the second half so shouldnt the first three be zeros or the first like seven should be zeros yeah theres  numbers so it should be zero zero zero up to at least four and then the rest should be numbers but ive got the reverse so its backwards zero two other half maybe i should say if q is less than let me try that nope it was better the other way oh i know why its because we changed it when we made the high values thing didnt we change it maybe not nevermind alright so this is clearly not doing the trick maybe we need to shift the elements yeah yeah youve gotta subtract i tried it right in here no that didnt work isnt that what i had right here n is the length right so i tried that and it didnt work so now maybe we should try doing this actually wait wait minus that and then when we print it  i dont understand why ive got a temp here should i try it yeah no i mean i named it temp two so it should be fine i think were just trying to do too much at once it might be something that we should do in two steps like two loops probably wont change anything no maybe we can declare this variable target dot length divided by two i am using target but i thought maybe we needed to use this shifting elements technique to get them not to start at zero yeah i know no no no no no no but thats okay let me go back lets simplify right middle why cant we set it to the middle i definitely dont need this okay i dont need this one so just to try and simplify i named this middle so that we dont have to keep putting that in but so the loop is from q the q is the middle and as long as its less than the middle  see thats the problem because its not less than the middle it should be as long as its less until the length right and then we dont really even need that well i guess its fine no we dont need that it made it more complicated okay i dont know yay its working i put  in yeah yeah should i run it again okay one two three four five yep looks good im just gonna put a couple comments in while you keep going oh my gosh where are you target okay do you want this variable because it makes it easier oh mmhmm affirmative yeah divided by two yeah and then the rest of it looks good no its more simple than we thought it was me too yeah and thats just the loop to print it yeah this whole thing is to print it because since its an array you have to use a loop to show everything in it yeah it worked for me yeah you can use i if you want a okay thats cool and then all you have to do is print it yeah you were i dont know why i used line i might get rid of that yeah thats right so were printing the target but for you its not b right yeah a and space yeah well see if it works i think theres a problem with a previous loop okay oh target q equals source q did you declare it up top declare it up top whyd you set it to  maybe set it to the length of the  i have n we do it no it doesnt say to did you want to get confirmation yeah i guess so im going to put comments in you do yeah i think its because we put a line break in earlier on if you scroll up ill bet you find that backslash n hm this should be fast right yeah dont want to make any mistakes yeah it depends on what youre trying to print but mostly yeah yeah yeah i dont know this doesnt work ive done something wrong oh okay all right where what do you mean yeah source and then  yeah wait no so listen to print an array to show all of the numbers in it you always have to have a loop yeah so this is what it looks like right here it always has this line with different whatever were going to call it then it prints inside it yeah because this is the one where you want it to print every time it goes around right so print the first one the second one all that all right let me try ive got to put this first the first part of the print statement needs to be somewhere else because otherwise it says it every time it shows a number it needs to be before the loop does that make sense its going to be a pain though yeah i wouldnt write  if i were you oh youre funny wait wait but since theres an if inside the loop you want to go one lower to the outside of the full loop yeah right there yeah yeah let me see if ive got it now make sure to put a new line at the end of these or else its a problem where right because you need an entire loop to show that youre printing this entire array so keep that line its good just put a loop around it like four and then int b or whatever just make sure it doesnt go past the length of the array yeah the source length i dont know is it yeah just put end brackets before the print and after the print after that yeah there you go thatll do it oh its because its l you need to say b so thats just bringing up  the first loop its going to bring up the first number the first number in the line second loop is going to bring up the second number so if the first number is two and the second number is four itll print those i think so i think its right im so glad i studied yeah you dont have time yeah i wouldnt say youll get the hang of it yeah thats why i asked david are we supposed to do a new loop every time i guess his answer was yes yeah the postlab and the prequiz i dont know why this prints new lines all the time maximum number is a problem i dont even remember where i put that the maximum number is im having a problem where its showing extra lines where it doesnt need to oh its this right here all right i think we should oh im trying to make arrays all right it should be  right one two three four five six seven  eight nine  maximum is eight thats right average is three okay nothings higher than three in here now theyve shuffled the original array so its the same numbers as up here its just jumbled up then this looks pretty good i think theres too many zeroes here because the original has zeroes in it yeah it looks good whats the problem thats good the nine is the maximum number but you might want to put writing that say the maximum number is that would be just right here after the n there looks good then for the arrays instead of doing a new line maybe you should just do a space so maybe instead of saying print line  up there yeah yeah and the thing that i discovered is if you want to write anything about this you should write it before the loop otherwise itll tell you too many times yeah print i dont know let me check midnight friday how are you doing yeah that looks good thats printing the array but its an array with only high values so thats good if you want to write anything about it though id recommend doing it before the loop yeah mmhmm affirmative array it doesnt really matter its just a description then change the line to just print and maybe add a space in between the numbers nice yeah itll look good nice all right youve got the high values but you still need the final  the shuffled one did you do the shuffled one oh you did no youre missing two the shuffled one and the last one yeah you could probably copy the same loop its going to be the same thing right so just take this whole two lines and the end bracket and just copy it up to where you want it just change it a little bit where do you want it yep looks good then just change the name of which array youre printing yeah yeah wait no it doesnt need to be s why oh i dont think it needs to be s because you already created the loop youre just calling it  it still needs to be the same as that loop no its fine this is just to show its working for me with multiple of the same one so i think its fine yeah yeah yeah thats true im going to fill out the exit form because this is working now yeah is it working thats good you just need to make sure theres a new line so maybe yeah after the space just do the  yeah thatll work it didnt oh wait take that back i think that you need to do it in the loop thats printing thats not the loop thats printing here right here i dont think so trial and error right wait wait a minute what oh i know you want to start a new line before the number is on the array so where do you see that up here put it right before the part no right before yeah thatll do it wow it looks perfect what do you mean the number on the array  different places if youre not sure which one youre on maybe we can put comments in as we go so that we know which loop does which yeah thats it right there april   whats your number four all right ready all right im clicking take quiz are you ready yeah its time lets do it all right yes okay yeah right match each part with the values of the array of the given line i dont understand oh yeah part one is declaring the array array is set to a new array no oh crosstalk  crosstalk  yeah then the next thing is calling the  now before its even initialized its calling the method yeah but array equals four basic math ops is a method so lets find that array is set to the exact same one that the method returns yeah wait why not oh i didnt notice that it was already labeled well thats easy so this array is set to a new array something about a different array  the bottom one yeah new alright i set  inaudible  and then number three different array right no its not right no i think zeros no oh yeah youre right well i think its different array than the one in the main method wait okay okay eight it could be this one after the line is compiled the array has the values eight four  zero yeah so part three is actually saying that one number is gonna now be x times y so im so lost are there more options here because this doesnt seem like enough thats true so lets just mark that for four yep part five is calling  but what if we put okay different array no eight four  zero yeah okay and then three is which ones three i dont know wait i have different array than the one in the main method initialized to size four for part two im just not sure about three well we might as well just try oh yeah for which part i dont think i did actually okay lets not use that one on three array is set to a new array oh you dont have that option wait its the top one alright yeah thats what is confusing about that part im not sure it must be though because none of the options kind of refer to just that one this is difficult okay there we go sorry when a method returns an array the blank of the array is returned the reference yeah good yeah i wont inaudible  okay now should we do b or c okay okay thats what i got i dont know well find out when oh it was a zero it probably divided by numbers that couldnt divide no its not multiply oh it is no six times two yeah because its not the remainder thing its an actual division so it would just be mmhmm affirmative yeah that seems right mmhmm affirmative no its six divided by two yeah but its the reverse its two divided by six and so it doesnt work because its an integer its not a so these are integers right so it cant be a decimal so if you had two and you divided it by six you would have zero point something but you cant have a decimal so you just have zero right is it oh then i dont know we better move on though do you want to do b or should we skip to c okay yeah maybe uh oh completed for homework whatever oh gosh for an argument of an array type crosstalk  is no i dont know  my book page numbers are different than the ones they mention one less yeah ill go back this is definitely wrong page for me my book is very different not for me it isnt yeah  okay no no this isnt right well ive read the whole thing but i dont remember it ive read the whole thing twice here we go i found it yeah the value of the argument is a references thats what i said reference method is the same as the array being passed okay attempt yeah yeah okay where yeah its  but then when it gets in there its changed to one so it prints as one i dont know yeah i think after the method the things that change are the ones with the brackets and the index number and the things that dont change are yeah this one does that ones good oh my gosh which one yeah yeah so this ones true so look array does change the things that arent arrays dont no its good no yes its okay inaudible  comes to mind what okay yeah different variables i just thought about it yeah thats what i said too youre doing great youre doing great no youre guessing right yeah okay im just confused by this its to confusing what yeah the difference is that youre just changing the name of the array youre not actually switching which one the first alright im just gonna submit it because im not really sure whatever well figure it out later now we need to do c hm yeah im not sure i submitted it and i didnt look at my wrong answer so okay so first lets just make the array  my computer is slow okay here we go alright yeah okay we need the scanner uh oh whatd i do hold on i misspelled this okay so now lets make the array so we need to make it a string type and its gonna be called name search yeah name search  the length is  okay is that what you have okay then we need to do array we have to create this array by taking in their input oh because thats the method oh so what do you want to call it okay okay so were gonna have to make a loop to get the user input no we gotta do that now inaudible  it says this array will get  names from the user so weve gotta get the names now so that theres something in the array so enter  names yeah alright now were definitely gonna need a loop yeah yeah search dot length is gonna have to go up and then open braces yeah like everything crosstalk  loop has to be enclosed yeah that looks good so now i guess wait names oh yeah okay wait no its gonna be the name lets change search to names because its really a list of names okay names equals input dot next line how do we do this i dont remember how to do that yeah okay initializing input values oh right dont forget to put i in the braces in the brackets crosstalk  the other one yes i have it here i think we need to change search dot length to names dot length okay looks good you dont need an i in the next line then so now the array has stuff in it so what did we want to do next call the method name search oh no we need to ask them for a name to search for yeah i called it names is that too similar i called it name without the s okay and now  goodness lets come back to this part and make the method down here yeah lets use string this one called name search yeah okay so in here we put like what were taking in which is a string right string names comma string name isnt that confusing okay but for the first part before the comma youre calling the string array so you need to put the sort of like square brackets with nothing in them yeah okay and then we could just do linear search how about that okay so well do we need to search for that string so let me find search not on mine oh youre right okay alright so we make a loop and we check if the key equals the array four great okay lets rewatch this video to make sure we know it see if theres any captions nope well you can see this one if you want i think this is basically what we just went through isnt that what we were doing right there looks like it to me its the same its what she did thats what she was doing the only difference i see is that its going down one over here you got it well so thats basically what she did right up there right so why are we call it bubble sort versus just normal sort like selection sort oh because she was comparing it to a key wasnt she to try and figure out if and this doesnt have a key it just doesnt so that makes sense all right lets see if we understand the questions all right lets code  oh this code calls the swap method because it says swap and it has parentheses and numbers in between oh i havent checked the i havent read the question yet hang on yeah it looks like selection sort doesnt it sorry i guess the problem im having is that in my textbook i didnt have the last page so i know about selection sort but i dont know about bubble sort somewhere in here copying erase no way too far yeah oh there it is so what is it saying does it look  no yeah youre right its bubble yeah oh thats all right we can do that okay the three and the five are going to stay the same right because so the first row here is showing what it was and then the second row shows that they found out that the three was less than the five so they swapped it yeah so those are going to stay the same and then check whether five and two are equal or less than  yeah so since five is greater than two its going to swap them right and then its going to have to  no this isnt right i got to rewatch the video okay lets go back to the beginning oops thats all right i set this to work slowly hang on normal we dont have time for that oops okay i was fine five see there this is a problem right there because now its still not in order its going to have to go through it all the way and then over again yep yeah youre right okay so lets go back yep so now weve got three two  wait five and eight its not changing yep yeah or eight stays the same so then the next row is also the same right three two five eight no not yet because we havent gotten to the end weve got to check whether the five and the eight are bigger than each other and since the five is less than the eight its going to stay in the same spot and not swap i think you actually check these two then you check these two then you check these two then you go back to the beginning and you check these two you check these two then you go back to the beginning and you check just those we are oh well its the value that goes down well i dont know this is what i think because were not  wait so this is one yeah we both got the same numbers there so it looks good well no so i think ignore these for a second and just look at the numbers you have these numbers and theyre out of order right first you check these two if three is less you swap them youve done that but next row youre checking the next two no because then you swap those two and you can see the two is still smaller than the three but  yeah thats what youve got for that row so then the next row youre checking these two and swapping them or not swapping them so this row will actually be the same as the previous row thats what i think and next time you start  yeah yep which would make that also do you think thats right it looks like what well okay all right so this one  the textbook yeah it does swap list i wish list current min index it just doesnt look like a swap okay it could be merge or heap i dont know enough weve already done bubble though do you have the textbook for merge and heap because ive never seen that before it says before answering this question with your partner discuss with the whole group how do we discuss it with the whole group no we just  oh well all right i guess okay current min  lets see what it looks like its doing whatd you do did you finish sixteen already all right lets walk through it this thing basically puts the smallest index i think its a combination of things right oh okay my computers freezing no its just frozen for some reason i cant scroll there we go all right so selection sort is our answer we never even heard about the other two so that cant be right okay lets recall our mystery method using the following okay this one goes through everything oh man okay i dont know it looks like the same as bubble sort to me is this a trick like is this two things that do the exact same thing okay all i can think to do is like  you want no not really oh i know the difference is selection sort sends it to the end it doesnt swap the two it sends the lower number no thats not right yeah okay so what do you think and then seven eight nine six is what ive got and then the next one is the same five was done crosstalk  how did the five jump to over there i dont understand that yeah that seems like its two steps in between the first row and the second row yeah i dont know why it would be like that well its like they took the first number and they placed it where it falls in order so maybe in the next one they took the first number two and they didnt move it because its still where it should be and then the next one i guess they would take the number two and not move it three wait they took the number three they didnt move it the next time they took the number five and didnt move it this time the eight would move so this looks good and then the next time theyre checking the seven which here hasnt moved and then eight and then yeah so i think its going to be the same answer every time until the last one where it flips so i dont think they check the six until the fifth time that theyre going through it yeah and the next one is also that one because theyre checking a nine at that point and the nine isnt necessarily in the wrong spot and then the next time theyre checking the six and they put it where it goes what do you think i mean that could be bubble sort but i think its selection sort okay should we try i think so i have no idea we can it doesnt say retake oh is it going to show us what we got wrong lets study our mistakes first all of them or wait what do you mean i got this one wrong it looks like its not supposed to be compile error but it isnt in order so maybe it would just give you a negative one because that was for the binary search this one its a binary search and the numbers are not in order so i thought it was compile error but maybe it would just return negative one yeah i think so well it says one out of one points so thats good so we only got one wrong maybe it was the first one maybe theres supposed to be three instead of four okay you were right here we should have thought about it more i said simplest answers the truth but it wasnt i know sorry thats because i havent studied it this ones  percent right though so we weve really got that down so thats good we did pretty well we need to ask for help with this section though yeah so should we try it again yeah all right search inaudible  and then you search binary search and then you search one negative one three binary search it checks the middle and then the middle is low so it checks higher so it never finds it this would be negative one eight is negative one nine is the third option ten is  pretty much everything is the same search if we try it again and we get a worse score is that what counts or does your highest score count okay then lets try it again cant hurt take again we cant it would be cheating i wonder why searching first is  yeah the first block of code is the linear search right yep and then  it returns one and it returns negative one with  what is this its the same question again isnt it what would we return to our found units all right were searching for six one two three yeah examine the above method its binary search and this one has one wait a minute no its negative one this is the one where we put compile error before its negative one and then the third option for question nine and then this one i think we need to start with three instead of four and its going to give us  i think its smaller new variable equals two no equals one now equals  wait what a new high variable equals two and mid is one maybe thats what we got wrong mid equals six with i think yeah and then equals the key and then theres no step eight wait we made two changes in here this isnt good i think the first one is still equal to four no yeah its three so our new high variable is yeah all right more efficient is binary search smallest and first this is multiple and neighboring and then we said this was bubble sort was that right all right lets see if we can redo this five  wait no three two five eight three two five eight three two i disagree i disagree yeah yeah and then the next one is also three two five eight and then three two five eight again yeah three two five eight the last ones two three five eight okay all right which one was this one selection sort great and this is where we got it wrong so im going to listen to you better what do you think its not  oh is it this one crosstalk  right here yeah right there so okay all right okay okay yeah oh the middles okay two three five eight wait the problem is that your example  let me check the last one the outside ones what are the outside ones four first we need the length right by the user oh okay  the scanner no yeah and then we got to make their array right we can use these as the index no keep telling me if im not doing something right cause i might make a big mistake okay does that make sense we want it from where does the plus one go ill just make it eight maybe okay wait so if this was a seven and there wasnt the plus two itd be from zero to seven but not including seven right so we want it to go from two to seven and include it so plus three okay does this need to be eight gram now cause now our range is only four wait we want a number between two and nine  seven cause thats what we want but plus two only gets us up two oh maybe we do need plus two max is i think this is right lets try the next step okay oh you already did that so we need to make a array but they said we needed to call it something we need to call it mayarray is this what you got good okay thats what im doing too  okay i think its in the spelling of wait no new nit okay thatll do it i wonder why its still not working oh it is okay now we need to fill it with random numbers what do you mean yeah and we need the nested lobs  no yeah what ever you would like  no no thats not what i mean i kinda like how its done in the textbook with the rows and columns just because otherwise were not going to remember what each thing is doing yeah oh does it no so like here where they say matrix we want to say main array but the second one we dont have to use length one or length to anymore cause we set it to equal the length rightinaudible  okay good so just the length of the whole array i guess we could just do it that way if you want to instead of doing all of this we could just do length one and length two is that what you want  i think it is because thats what we set it to so i think thats good logic yeah lets do it that way yes you do okay its got to fill with random numbers between one and nine okay you know what im changing my mind on the random numbers at the top i think instead of seven we need eight cause we want it to be inclusive of the last number right yeah i think we should crosstalk  i dont think its three whats that yeah so thats where wed have a plus one but we might as well just write eight yeah i can keep my hand up while you finish well for us we want to do int math dot random times nine and then plus one so it doesnt start from zero cause we need a number from one to nine try and get that to come around you know length is a hard word to spell i think it might be the t and the h need to be swapped up there yeah there we go it is your array  it is your array okay now we need to print the array so that should be just oh we just wanted to get confirmation that our logic is good for the math random so this is we need a number from two to nine including eight right so its gonna start from zero if we dont put the plus two right and then so what you need to do is do max minus mean which is seven yeah eight eight this is good ten is too high okay thank you minus min plus one plus whatever the min all right so this should be good so lets try and yeah its nice yeah now we know i think were gonna need these nested loops again in order to crosstalk   yeah number b wait no no we havent done b yet were gonna do b yeah were gonna need two loops to do that though why dont we just use the same text from up here again yeah sounds good  yeah so were gonna want to print in between each of those end brackets so one up yeah that looks good no i take it back i thought you had already done that so we just dont need this last row of writing and were gonna have to print there  yeah yeah its not actually its printing the value at the intersection of these two indexes  no its only printing whats there yeah it looks great and then after the last bracket ends do the closed one oh youre missing one i think you need another maybe two more yeah thats better all right so im gonna go right in between these next two end brackets put this on oh it is printing both yeah yeah lets run it and see what happens this isnt good we need to format it differently  we need to print both and i think were not doing that we to  hey howd you do that okay let me try thats nice this isnt right though cause the numbers in here can only be between one and nine oh they are okay thats good so whatever these random numbers were i think they ended up being six that time but if we print it again itll be a different size okay yeah that onesinaudible  thats so satisfying okay yes thank you okay so were on c now calculate the average of numbers in each column look cause were gonna calculate the average later so it should be double all right then lets start with nit  its okay all right so we need to add them together first what do you mean wait but the first number has to be the total so were gonna have to go through it im a hand you a loop oh like a counter or the sum end sum equals zero well we dont have the average yet yeah but we can do that late oh okay well do both hows that no youre thinking in order and im thinking out of order so this is good yeah yes so it said to calculate the average of the column so the column is everything down that way basically doing this except that the total or the sum yeah so i think were gonna have to adapt it i think this is what we need cause its always gonna be zero right cause thats the first one but the i is gonna go up as opposed oh sum plus equals yeah that looks good yeah all right great yeah  so weve already got average so we can say average equals sum yeah youre right we dont even need that divide by well im doing length too  print yeah yeah but you should probably describe it so we know what were printing  oh no so we were supposed to calculate the average of the numbers in each column so we do need double loops we need the average of every number so or do they want it for wait from the average of all columns or the average of all numbers i guess what i misread was i thought it said calculate the average of the numbers in the first column but they mean in every column so we need to make it check every variable  i think its just one like all together like the average of every column cause then it says print average of all columns the average does not have to include digits after decimal point  yeah so lets just add this part in this middle line cause thats what i skipped i thought we didnt need it but we do so im changing i to row okay yeah yeah row all right okay i know right okay okay wait i think the outer loop should be length one and the inner loop should be length two so heres what ive changed yeah length one and where it says that matrix were not using that  yeah the columns and rows okay  oh know yeah sounds like it wait a minute uh oh its not divided by length two anymore its divided by length two times length one right to get every number im gonna have to do that okay what you got i have inaudible  yeah and i might put parenthesis around those two so that it does that before the division  great lets test it well that makes sense  whatd you get thats great no im notso what else do we need to do find a maximum oh gosh find the maximum average and print it we did that we did that but what do they mean by method it has to be in a method oh cause its length dot something thats fine  all right wait it needs to print in a decimal though so in the end it does need to be a double can be  does not have to include okay so lets not worry about it the maximum average value is okay so we need to find wait a minute what do they mean by maximum average so they did want a bunch of different averages shoot so we were right before we just needed to do it for all our columns yeah i think what theyre doing is  yeah but like if you look at column one two plus four plus five divided by three is three and six plus six plus two so we need to actually do those in separate loops so what we had before was actually good yeah so we need to make a bunch of different averages of the columns so no no i think they just said length method i dont think its so think about this how do we get that so lets just put a zero where it says row and see if that does it why not okay but its always gonna start at zero right no but this is the index number the index number are gonna go one two  three every single time  how do you know when to stop because instead of four loops it stops after that blank right yeah yeah i agree  yeah i think we dont need the inner loop again sorry about that and then instead of column these row i for column and row column column inaudible   yeah lets do that yeahmine too all right so the column is the first now your angel this needs to be column and its going up right  yeah so thats not good but if we did column here then it would be zero the first time which is good right and then it would be two three four till the end of the was how many columns there are but this is what we need to figure out because first we want it to be i then the next time we want it to be i plus one we want this to go up slowly right go real slowly not as fast as thing goes up so its like we need another loop outside of this the same as what we had but how were they separated out but we only got one number and we want an average for every single column well okay lets do it this way  if we did it like this were getting the average for just the one first column right you need this to go up and we need to get i mean we could do it again right maybe and then what we change is right here this zero thats a good idea lets do that so were just gonna take this whole thing put it lower down i did i dont know if were gonna need it or not yeah right im gonna put a space in here so we can see it properly okay you know what i think we need to put average back outside of it okay did you bring sum no you didnt okay ill take these back up i remember length more yeah okay we have to change the length to main array dot length cause i didnt bring length one into unless you want to  dot length now why are you calling this average i thought what this does okay thats fine i put this and then maybe we should put index or something so that we can if we put index there and we put index instead of zero great down here and then no lower what do you have length in the brackets below you dont want that you want index but then we need to declare it outside of this loop too i mean outside of the method no i wont okay so now lets figure out what were doing down here weve done thisand now after this we want it to go up right yeah okay okay called it yeah so i know we need to make the index go up but i think we need to do that up here like outside   so im gonna take that up and were gonna so up here weve got actually lets put this down in here oh gosh okay so we need a limp here we could probably put this is the method dont you think well make that what is the result hows that well just say we cant use length two this isnt good we cant use length two and this isnt good either i think we should bring in length two as well and just change main array dot length to length two its just easier i think line one refers to how far across to row but we want to get how far down the i might have it reversed but well find out  return average whats that no one higher okay so this needs to be in a loop maybe a wild loop maybe yeah yeah lets see if this works oh wait we havent called it we cant just say average anymore we have to call this method call them average and then we have to put all of those things in it yeah two index okay im gonna test it see how it goes oops well i dont know i still had it written the average ball columns but its really the averages the first column okay oh sorry let me try it again oh thats easy the average okay so ive got the lengths reversed i think i need to i think we both need to change this to length two here and then in the method bring in length one instead  okay lets see this is bad i think this should be minus one lets try that again this is probably here and it needs to be minus one here too lets try that oh man i cant calculate that nine five three five seven seven one so theres how many numbers wait one two three okay four thats not bad wait but there are one two three four five six seven columns and theres one two three four five six so it should have printed another plat maybe i didnt need this one here no i need that one there see it should have printed twice why is the average one this isnt right two plus eight is ten divided by two is five the average should be five  well yeah i switched it so its length one here and its length thats weird yeah see this one didnt get an error why would it sometimes give an error and sometimes not oh it must be something wrong with crosstalk  random numbers this isnt good so this thing is cycling through and getting index the first time this is zero and this one is also zero then the next time its one and two and three it does but only each time we call the method so were calling it a loop so maybe thats the problem but we cant call it in a loop i dont know wait so yeah i think it might be our random numbers maybe these need to be back to seven lets try it with seven row okayinaudible  were using length one for row and length two for columns so maybe we do need length two and length two here  but this one should only ran with length one and length two lets try that one two three four five oh im counting the wrong way one two three four five so this should go one two three four five times i think were getting the average of the rows instead of the columns five  divided five would be like  or something okay thats not it than what about do you want to try the five seven and five five seven  one six eight eight five divided by eight yeah i dont know what this number is than it doesnt match up for the average of this or that  what happens if we dont use this line and instead we just increment it out average is three so this     divided by five that is three this is three so thats good yeah  divided by five so weve got it once the question is just how do we do it another time and this loop is not the kind of loop we need so maybe we should try a four loop okay cant hurt right cant i use index this might do the same thing as what we were just doing before you se theres only three columns so it should only oh blank two sorry maybe without the minus one sorry one two what do we count like one two three four five six seven eighth one two three four five six i dont have a minus one on here anymore should i take it off from here whys it only showing us two its like the whole thing is averaging the rows instead of the columns so maybe what we need is columns on this side oh that makes sense thats probably because i been changing this one back and forth cause i cant figure it out yeah then we definitely need a minus one yeah  this is not right yeah oh well at least that one was doing the right thing there one of these has to be column two this ones gotta be column one right cause were counting how many numbers there are in the column but if we do that were gonna need to call it in wait this is red though one two three four five one two three four five so why are we then getting this one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven okay this is good  should i try it again its the random numbers that are no good i changed these right sorry this is very bad yeah sometimes sometimes not okay got a loop calling it and a loop in the method so it might be looping too many times theyre all at the top oh i know we shouldnt be using the index as the counter index should be its own thing and then we could use i its going up so its making the range get smaller that makes sense lets see if we can fix it then okay thanks i think i figured it out cause the way we had it we were making this go up and then making that go up oh i is less than oops that was my problem i had it turned the opposite way i was graded on four all right so it says this method gets twodimensional array as input and count the average of all elements the second one no yeah youre right just as a reminder assignment three is due in two days april th th no itll be fine yeah what do we call it like display maybe display array maybe okay yeah its twodimensional so its got two empty spaces no its its own thing so heres what ive got so far so if we store their input as something and then we put that into this array instead of zero it would be whatever we call it so like if they say they want there to be seven rows then whatever were calling their answer well put in here yeah okay  yeah oh yeah you could im going to leave mine um array thats what i called mine does it say that turns twodimensional rides with the main method to create a method i think we should just crosstalk  them write in what numbers they want in it like say enter this many numbers and well store those in here yeah so right now up until this point all weve done is created an empty array with zeros at all locations and so weve asked them how big we want it to be we havent put anything in it so i feel like the only way we can move forward is to ask them to put some of the numbers crosstalk  yeah here yeah yeah i used that and i was like i dont think its going to run without that there are errors in the book for sure i mean remember when she did the exercise from the book and it didnt work yeah thats probably good yeah what thats the length of crosstalk  yeah okay no right now its anything you enter no youre fine i dont think i dont think this is good though so first we asked them for the lengths of the columns and the rows oh let me try that one more time to make sure that were on the right track where after this loop oh just nothing i dunno  there my main total was going to be  theres a problem with this though we need to get the user input at least for the lengths before the method because right now if this is a method that returns an array we cant print the array right because wed have to know how to do these loops but we cant know how long to set each loop because we dont know this number so were going to have to ask them for the lengths outside of the method okay so like if instead of all this stuff i deleted all this and we just said return array then in order to print it wed have to say system got out but wed also have to put it in those loops right it doesnt work i tried i mean i can give the lengths and enter numbers and everything but its not going to print it right because it needs to be in loops a lot ill get there i didnt think of it see i entered all the numbers but i cant print it so maybe we should ask them these things earlier passed them into the left so lets take these first five rows no just this part okay thats a good sign you probably did it right so now we need it up above so now were actually going to be passing these numbers in right its n and its n sorry what else oh yeah nice input that next thats good you do oh thats right did that fix it yeah youre right thats what we needed okay so now instead of getarray we need to put that around some loops right this isnt good no its not yeah i mean weve got the length for the array but we cant oh could put n comma n yeah so you might only need one loop let me test it no that didnt work why dont we do all of the creation up here and then the display down here okay lets do that its okay we can just move it right i have to move a lot i have to move a lot we have to take everything except return right well because those double loops are putting the numbers into the array no so the lengths are already above this is the numbers inside the array i think we need to to display i think so i mean we cant ever display if we do that just display it and send the answer up yes  calculate the average right sorry okay but how did they get the lens okay so this is oh  got it so if m equals and here we just say m i and oops j and then make another loop here thats for j does that sound good and then this is a print line right so getarray is this and we no longer need that right and then as long as what we return im using what you just showed me yeah yeah yeah right right that looks good so the only real problem left here is theres no problem let me try it no problem trying to save me from myself oops i forgot to put the other print line down that would have to be here right okay two rows three columns so if were doing this in theory oh yeah this is all good lets do this yeah i mean youve got to get the lengths in the main because otherwise you wont know how to use them up here to print it right its a good thing you said that about the extra line the extra print line because i was just going to be stuck because i didnt know thats funny oh the next thing were going to do is the average weve got to do the average method soon yeah it should be fine im going to youve got to finish the fore loop i think yeah youre good wait are you in the method there i think youre on auto pilot a little bit because instead of doing that we want to do the method but it printed so do you have did you declare it up here like set it to the value of m okay yeah put that one higher up and set it to m so that we can just call m yeah and its twodimensional yeah so now you can use m and i crosstalk  yeah yeah m then i and j and i put a space in between them yeah because youve got wait  it looks fine no no you need that go back down you havent declared array so do something like insarray crosstalk  equals yeah this line well the way i figure it were creating one in the method and then were just assigning it a new name outside of the method like in the main method yeah no youre good with the beginning of that row that line up higher higher higher right there it needs to say array thatll fix it its okay so now lets get the average okay so lets make a new method no we can just call the other method yeah that didnt work it doesnt seem like that would work so maybe we need to call it wait yeah so can we put that right in here okay no it doesnt look like we can yeah that could be the problem lets just do the stuff in the middle yeah lets do two four loops and then the sum again okay  ill worry about that part later im putting the loops in no this is so wrong im holding in hang on okay so lets keep going im not sure yet i figured wed go back and get it later i dont know if im doing it right okay ill slow down no youre right maybe we just need the array but i think its called m it is working with m if you put m there instead of array it works m i j no it doesnt work i take it back were getting the sum first and then were going to use that to get the average i did yeah all right sum divided by oops first were just going to calculate the average in there and then turn the average i set the sum up here equal to zero but here you dont need it because youre saying the datatype right there or at least its not giving an error okay click okay well where are we well i figured the length of the entire that cough is going to be really loud on this thing should we test these no theres no problem we just need to make sure the main method crosstalk  yeah so well just put that in there the average or average okay n comma n yeah i brought down both ns both ns oh and the m thats better all right im testing it ah no  no it didnt work oh wait no it did work i take it back it did work i just didnt tell it that this last thing is the average yeah  because thats what the prompt said right oh sorry let me see we need to make it print yeah nice thatll work where scroll down yeah it looks good sum divided by thats what ive got okay scroll down a little theres an error on the oh no keep going maybe theres too many brackets somewhere no that looks fine scroll up again it could be where youre doing things up here okay whats this line doing right there intarray well how come youve got that there ive got that way down in the method intarray should be in getarray yeah and then make sure its in the getarray method scroll down to look yeah that looks good theres an i in there now okay i wonder why it didnt give you more of an error okay exception main wait let me see where ive got that yeah wait can you scroll back up for a second it all looks good to me all right lets start from the bottom weve got literally the same thing here and mines working yours is not mmhmm affirmative mmhmm affirmative oh youve got them both set to n change that first one to n all right yay now lets do part  yeah we can put comments in later i thought he said dont put pseudocomments okay write a program that searches for a character in twodimensional array for this you need to define a method that creates a twodimensional array with userdefined size and close the array with random characters and also instead of filling it with user input were filling it with random characters and its characters its not numbers so weve got to do it with characters i still think we should take pretty much all of this and adapt it  start a new file you dont want to lose it oh no okay and make sure the title is the same as what you saved it as i did were going to have to go through it and change the type of the array to character right okay oh no i think we should start from scratch because its with characters so i think we do lets just try and work through it step by step yeah can you actually have a character array or do we need to make it as an integer array and then convert it to random characters so should we declare it as a character array all right okay so okay okay im calling it array all right so we need to use method again i wonder yeah so i moved this last line into the method because it seems like it should go there and then all we have to put into the array is n and n like in the method into n and into n all right so in and then i just set it here oh wait lets use m again hows that how are we going to generate random characters so i wish i had that chapter yeah i dont even know how to start wait no no that might actually be in the book well find it yeah  no i think its in this most recent one actually or maybe seven no youre right it might not be in these chapters like what you mean char oh okay thats good you need another loop though you need two nested loops since its a so were working with twodimensional arrays yeah thats good wont they show you the alphabet oh it printed numbers though so you can convert that from unicode yeah i mean i think the answers are right they just need to be converted back oh hey but how do we make it random yeah that makes sense okay so for us its nice for us we do two loops to put these random things into it right lets do it together yeah i might just do it  wait a minute no its still going to be the same loops and then well do that later  whyd you do one im doing zero no that cant be it because thats not true all right so so were going to do array with the i and j equals  a random thing right now how do you do that again math dot random wait or char youd have to do int first all right  z minus a for the range plus the minimum which is a right am i right wait so this is the range max minus min plus one right you think we should do int first  no its working yeah im doing a bunch of parentheses yeah yeah and then outside of those plus a should it be minus a yep and then if you put a semicolon at the end and open parentheses before math all right  i think so we just need to make sure to remember to call it no because we havent called it no ive gotten the return but i havent made it print so we needed two four loops again yeah i think so wait is that what were supposed to do i dont know we dont need to we can just ask them for a character and if its there so we need to make another method that searches for the character okay but we cant let them see it because then theyll always win the game yeah thats where it is but  were not printing it yeah now its called m right so m i gosh i hope this works  wait okay were getting close were getting close did yours work yeah im going to test it oh it worked but we got the wrong characters its probably that yeah oh i made it worse i changed it to a instead of plus   these arent the lowercase characters i think we need to change our range or maybe we need more parentheses i mean its working its just  got some issues i did it it just needed more parentheses around the z and the a whyd you erase the whole thing i think it would be good to change the narrative because i think youre very smart yeah lets not do that anymore no more  no outside of that i have a plus a just to be safe yeah  okay somethings different oh no its good sorry that looks good all right so now lets make one more method and then well be done wait let me try again okay thats not good plus  okay wait i got rid of the one and i still dont get z or a it could have just been chance let me try again oh i got a yeah its all good but i didnt get z one you can still get as so maybe what we needed was minus one okay wait dont get rid of this a on the outside okay minus one doesnt work yeah its better like this  crosstalk  so what we really need is for the z to be plus one oh yeah thats it crosstalk  nice did we get any zs i think i figured it out we need it to be z plus one minus a dont we okay lets try that nope thats not it what about z plus a whats half to z well we have the plus one crosstalk  either lets try it again try it one more time theres a z we might need two plus ones yeah lets try that lets see what happens oh its worse its better to have it what did you do four yeah recited mine okay hang on all right im just following what she did before she said five and nine no it doesnt matter yeah um so where are you at okay so the way yeah thats what i dont know but i know that its gonna have to be in the loop like in the first loop well everything happens within this big loop and then theres smaller loops inside it for sure like this set of two loops is gonna print it right i think we should do it like this okay lets go back so up here lets start the loop and then do the like press enter command and maybe itll just work on its own who knows hey it worked but it did all of it too fast i never pressed enter yeah exclusive yeah that looks good okay so then we need to get the user input but i think theres a trick to this like we need to say no but it printed it all without me pressing enter it did it all right but like i never pressed anything so it should only be like if i dont know really okay oh i got it i just put inputnextline just thats it yeah so this works oh um its the counter of the first loop for you its i and then the second number is the random number so for you its index so like right so mine looks like this yeah think so she made this too easy for us huh she made it too easy for us she told us to rush well yeah theres no mystery anymore yeah okay but dont forget since this is a twodimensional array now youre gonna have to do two loops around the print statement yeah you always have to cause right now youre gonna do two index numbers but you dont have anything to yeah so just make two loops yeah i used k and q i dont know you could try the rows the rows and then the second moves the columns  the second ones gotta be the yeah okay and then it should be fine to just print it and dont forget were gonna have to need another print line yeah like you taught me i would press the stop on there and see if theres anything missing even in doing the second print line  i think its one higher yeah i wonder why it wasnt working could just be the computer i think its just the computer did you want a space inbetween the quotation marks okay maybe thatll work oh you have to press enter nice its good its just that you never like said press enter to the user so like up yeah before that line little tired oh on the part where youre prompting them to say enter you wont put that in the first loop so like take that part all the way down the only thing that should be outside of the loop is the declaration cause we want them to ask over and over again no yeah mmhmm affirmative yeah pretty much that should do it okay yay wait a minute how come you only have four rows oh you set it to one you can set it to zero in the beginning but then you need to set all the other loops to zero as well youre okay all right nice does that have nine across it looks like it so its only gonna put a one in each row mmhmm affirmative no it starts from first and then it could be anywhere on the row hopefully and then we need to do the checking to see if theyve won which is this part yeah like two before yeah first you need a boolean variable so that you can figure out whether they won or not yeah yeah um yeah the if statement goes inside the second loop so basically were just gonna do the same two loops that we did out here but instead of printing well instead of having it set to five and nine we have it set to nine and five and then we can swap oh this needs to be h and this needs to be b no but basically like we just need the same old loops again but were swapping the lengths cause thats the equivalent of nine on the top and five on the bottom and then well do the if else youre using i j okay yeah so they swap yeah matrix for you its called array and you wanna make it set to like use the counter from the inner loop for the first part and the counter from the outer loop for the second so instead of zero and zero the inner loop one yeah yeah that looks good yeah that looks good the brackets yeah too close yeah and then last thing is make a little if else statement to print whether they won or lost is it called array scroll up for a second int of array oh i know no i dont know oh if it equals instead of like making a new assignment yeah so then all you need is some sort of if else to show them whether theyve won or not yeah right well keys a boolean right so it can be true or false okay yeah im just gonna put in some comments for a second is it working you won youre a winner but it worked i wonder how many times you have to try it for you to win its addicting huh i dont know i think its working fine though are there more questions no thats it if you really wanted to know you could make your arrays way smaller so like let me test this cause mines the same as yours right ill make it three and four hows that and set this to four okay let me try again well i mean its an improbable program isnt it oh i was so close that time let me try one more time oh its just fun its just fun oh if you get all the ones in the same column yeah yeah thats okay though i guess so im trying to write some comments in to make sure okay how you doing okay okay okay you wanna do the exit form pseudo code laughs is it working there it is okay lets see oh no the grades hes updated the grades i dont wanna see it okay lets do the exit form instead catch the train why oh click on the title uh just wait a second its thinking wait okay once there and then just once up top yeah um are you logged in it looks like its logged you out like are you logged in in a different email account at all yeah switch users switch to the one that does your school account yeah okay were taking this off  i gotta go to the bathroom soon i need to go to the bathroom ill hold it are other people confused or whats happening,good  right  need  choose  either  one  yeah  menu  one  want  square  going  ask  dimension  square  yeah  ask  whats  length  side  yeah  going  ask  one  side  going  store  let  call  x  print  output  one  square  still  square  right  two  rectangle  let  one  next  whats  length  side  im  showing  right  showing  method  right  exactly  behind  scene  make  sense  ask  two  variable  length  width  rectangle  thats  okay  im  sketching  quickly  program  triangle  said  square  yeah  think  thats  switch  statement  right  youre  putting  detail  well  need  map  method  would  look  like  next  yeah  write  four  method

one  also  go  one  go  one  go  let  try  thats  okay  want  new  class  working  activity  wow  weve  come  long  way  create  make  sure  dont  checked  youre  creating  method  dont  want  pretty  sure  say  write  four  method  get  dimension  shape  right  well  combination  let  try  ill  make  new  sure  think  yeah  ill  write  like  first  want  write  switch  statement  right  first  want  start  scanner  weve  got  give  menu  option  right  yeah  menu  option  choose  square  rectangle  triangle  last  one  circle  hm  oh  sure  could  right  well  later  want  store  input  string  right  said  guideline  way  yeah  youre  right  let  reread  instruction  user  input  either  uppercase  lowercase  mixed  mean  cant  use  switch  could  convert  yeah  think  youre  right  yep  let  string  input  equal  get  weve  asked  enter  option  need  store  answer  dont  know  could  anything  theyll  type  though  theyll  type  word  square  word  rectangle  might  uppercase  didnt  put  one  put  square  string  input  dot  next  line  equal  square  yeah  work  square  need  also  there  different  method  need  equal  like  regardless  whether  uppercase  lowercase  want  two  uppercase  two  lowercase  equal  ignore  case  thats  want  want  one  equal  ignore  case  choice  dot  equal  ignore  case  remind  capitalized  wait  working  quotation  oh  sorry  ive  forgotten  wait  working  something  though  usually  something  dot  equal  isnt  well  dont  try  got  one  choice  dot  equal  ignore  case  dot  choice  parenthesis  thats  good  equal  cant  choice  anymore  need  square  yeah  yeah  think  theyve  chosen  square  need  print  whats  length  side  yeah  going  work  dont  start  scanner  let  try  length  equal  input  dot  next  double  thought  doesnt  need  yeah  right  weve  got  number  oh  sorry  ill  say  side  hows  side  side  want  square  need  put  method  well  need  write  method  yeah  calculation  square  right  square  beginning  say  want  double  right  thats  calling  method  need  create  method  itll  print  right  need  calculation  square  right  double  area  equal  side  time  side  right  return  area  im  confused  let  see  think  good  might  something  wrong  might  need  call  x  instead  side  okay  right  trying  yeah  youre  right  probably  need  variant  could  right  one  one  think  also  line  say  print  right  side  area  right  idea  yeah  right  method  signature  mean  well  say  square  something  wrong  think  double  result  equal  square  side  square  side  oh  want  change  stored  variable  method  thats  supposed  create  area  square  right  everything  look  good  double  area  equal  oh  maybe  need  parenthesis  around  oh  helped  dont  know  also  double  result  make  result  instead  area  shouldnt  matter  name  return  really  double  area  right  result  could  side  doesnt  matter  think  using  word  instead  number  thinking  number  somehow  put  parenthesis  shouldnt  matter  oh  maybe  bracket  wrong  spot  oh  took  bracket  helped  going  need  open  think  whole  method  need  go  bottom  thats  wrong  need  way  bottom  think  yeah  go  perfect  think  thatll  work  try  really  wont  get  anything  right  kind  unfinished  right  yeah  cant  start  oh  okay  square  didnt  work  dont  loop  need  loop  right  need  looping  yeah  im  kind  talking  guess  oh  need  print  statement  thats  oh  got  system  let  print  might  yes  right  mean  oh  sure  thats  good  idea  ill  change  math  dot  side  im  going  delete  oh  youre  right  need  another  formula  square  side  time  side  enter  oh  youre  right  ill  stop  talking  thats  good  like  idea  oh  square  square  side  yeah  yep  right  theyre  calling  method  oh  there  two  different  thing  right  there  square  name  method  there  square  side  youve  called  input  actually  one  need  square  one  need  square  oh  probably  bracket  add  bracket  close  bracket  mean  brace  closed  get  rid  get  rid  one  go  awesome  need  different  statement  part  bottom  method  term  ifs  still  need  put  three  option  yeah  think  brace  another  right

like  large  wild  loop  wan  na  make  smaller  loop  inside  right  here  smaller  counter  use  next  loop  character  index  well  dont  mean  index  mean  character  index  right  going  char  one  would  x  equal  well  put  vowel  well  figure  code  later  maybe  there  debate  equal  want  increase  counter  right  need  new  counter  using  counter  loop  using  counter  one  method  mean  easier  first  yeah  let  say  number  vowel  equal  something  like  number  vowel  plus  plus  dont  think  yeah  well  say  get  make  vowel  bigger  hows  yes  well  make  coming  way  guess  like  l  something  program  youre  right  yeah  youre  right  think  need  say  thats  there  problem  cause  right  would  need  make  x  bigger  x  plus  plus  yeah  need  make  sure  x  go  one  higher  next  time  checking  index  make  sure  youre  making  x  bigger  thats  different  thing  thats  number  vowel  alright  im  lost  isnt  okay  read  first  character  sentence  e  u  make  counter  go  one  yeah  okay  let  let  try  code  wan  na  stack  minute  ill  put  see  code  flowchart  im  gon  na  start  importing  scanner  already  finish  already  okay  string  equal  input  dot  line  yeah  let  well  mean  gon  na  actually  anything  yet  might  put  like  name  method  vowel  count  yeah  yeah  might  want  capitalize  count  let  try  figure  method  fix  part  later  oh  yeah  string  open  brace  dont  think  think  need  declare  counter  mmhmm  affirmative  feel  worried  let  keep  trying  see  come  im  sure  first  let  get  length  okay  thats  got  need

thats  good  idea  let  copy  whole  part  bowlian  vowel  probably  need  parenthesis  yeah  isnt  working  oh  supposed  say  equal  there  error  x  error  cause  ive  got  x  higher  still  working  think  need  know  call  yeah  convert  integer  look  convert  integer  cause  might  allowed  like  say  equal  dont  know  maybe  need  parenthesis  oh  see  make  sense  okay  wait  kind  variable  thought  character  sorry  character  okay  wait  ch  equal  schar  x  going  need  method  isnt  good  think  youre  something  need  let  organize  go  work  moved  x  higher  one  working  think  thats  good  x  whats  going  put  higher  okay  create  character  yeah  thats  good  right  yeah  yeah  put  x  parenthesis  let  see  oh  yeah  dont  remember  im  late  okay  ch  equal  hm  oh  six  nine  six  f  yeah  six  nine  sorry  six  f  okay  dont  forget  there  zero  six  okay  like  ch  let  see  get  error  yep  nice  thats  awesome  okay  wait  hang  okay  really  dont

think  work  without  zero  want  test  okay  want  u  show  value  index  need  change  show  loop  want  run  find  final  answer  want  print  answer  fact  one  want  print  every  time  loop  doe  help  tried  didnt  work  yeah  cool  question  better  use  one  loop  everything  one  loop  need  separate  loop  like  abcd  depend  oh  close  alright  sorry  okay  cause  weve  got  know  basically  answering  theory  use  loop  thspeaker  okay  alright  okay  wouldnt  work  started  thing  loop  like  put  right  something  answer  thanks  okay  yeah  let  cant  im  copying  first  loop  work  faster  change  though  cause  dont  want  right  want  something  else  happen  okay  okay  alright  ive  made  empty  loop  okay  one  want  add  oh  doesnt  seem  care  yeah  youre  right  let  use  different  one  let  use  k  use  fourth  loop  okay  oh  working  okay  alright  great  thats  fine  alright  okay  yeah  think  alright  enter  number  print  line  new  line  didnt  say  max  put  max  oh  supposed  ten  hundred  thought  oh  shoot  need  change  okay  okay  line  large  definitely  shouldnt  print  would  long  im  taking  line  dont  want  print  anymore  im  gon  na  print  maximum  let  try  working  oh  max  equal  source  need  decore  max  use  statement  wait  thats  right  look  mine  doesnt  thats  weird  there  restates  yeah  try  go  alright  yeah  im  intimidating  make  empty  loop  work  dont  know  oh  yeah  finished  b  c  next  loop  yeah  there  two  step  making  average  first  need  get  total  number  added  together  divide  many  number  right  loop  get  u  total  well  divide  yeah  im  calling  inch  though  dont  double  still  recording  yeah  okay  okay  yeah  put  loop  really  need  one  line  loop  add  every  number  yeah  would  outside  loop  right  cause  need  get  number  together  go  outside  loop  average  yeah  sorry  number  way  oh  thats  semicolon  colon  go  yeah  average  oh  one  line  get  average  yeah  well  cause  loop  inside  thing  repetitively  want  one  thing  yeah  youre  good  well  im  worried  total  n  integer  dont  tell  want  division  like  precise  thing  dont  think  wed  need  number  three  three  average  well  dont  print  okay  let  test  see  go  oh  got  ta  new  line  going  cause  look  really  bad  im  gon  na  swap  new  line  go  write  j  twice  oh  working  thats  awesome  nice  look  good  alright  find  element  higher  value  average  value  yeah  let  use  yeah  one  right  let  start  another  loop  dont  know  think  want  inside  say  number  whatever  yeah  greater  average  might  need  declare  average  average  weve  got  loop  need  pull  somehow  dont  oh  okay  higher  want  send  new  array  mean  need  declare  new  array  let  declare  call  high  value  oh  okay  isnt  okay  isnt  right  way  like  right  okay  hows  yeah  oh  right  wait  cant  quite  read  type  size  let  make  size  let  say  inch  cant  say  n  told  u  size  gon  na  n  loop  need  create  new  la  type  size  source  array  got  ta  size  go  dont  know  imagine  number  bigger  average  need  make  new  variable  put  one  put  like  high  value  l  yeah  thats  make  sense  need  keep  really  sorry  im  distracted  use  one  copying  maybe  part  instead  whole  step  could  baby  step  like  store  value  somehow  okay  say  think  would  work  okay  got  ta  print  way  think  yeah  okay  thats  team  right  actually  might  far  loop  let  try  little  bit  farther  dont  know  gon  na  work  average  printing  every  single  number  right  thats  want  want  print  larger  oh  need  take  lower  think  actually  might  want  something  l  well  cant  well  need  oh  cant  print  print  array  mean  another  loop  yeah  printing  loop  got  ta  remember  displaying  array  need  use  entire  loop  print  let  useful  yeah  use  k  though  okay  oh  still  working  cant  print  l  print  b  okay  im  gon  na  try  see  working  okay  working  oh  actually  nevermind  wait  average  six  printed  thing  higher  six  think  thats  didnt  put  anything  value  like  index  feel  zero  error  oh  array  yeah  high  value  array  see  none  number  smaller  six  unless  count  zero  think  zero  placeholder  shuffle  random  shuffling  thats  next  step  yeah  right  look  hard  look  hard  think  part  kind  like  remember  th  value  swap  place  two  exact  thing  okay  im  gon  na  put  comment  loop  remember  whoop  sorry  yeah  already  yeah  right  print  array  dont  didnt  say  like  could  youd  fine  youre  good  instead  let  new  loop  yeah  two  yeah  yeah  thats  good  right  yeah  thats  one  thats  basically  wrote  im  noticing  something  okay  gon  na  go  far  oops  let  minus  one  hows  one  source  yeah  randomly  shuffle  based  random  number  need  think  since  two  loop  kind  need  two  different  variable  im  gon  na  use  im  gon  na  change  one  cant  use  n  weve  already  used  n  let  say  okay  wont  let  u  oh  dont  know  got  error  oh  would  want  wait  im  int  yeah  dont  need  bracket  need  thats  alright  good  yeah  right  im  still  using  okay  little  piece  like  equivalent  u  calling  variable  like  x  right  equivalent  made  temporary  variable  set  x  im  setting  x  ill  set  temp  swapped  place  two  number  since  theyre  actually  calling  part  array  switching  two  number  two  different  array  one  array  right  one  array  dont  know  two  number  random  number  called  shuffling  index  shuffling  number  place  right  thats  right  though  giving  error  think  used  double  number  actually  integer  yeah  thats  im  making  note  dont  forget  im  close  point  forget  im  thing  okay  thats  wait  let  go  back  dont  think  okay  f  yeah  gon  na  hard  gon  na  call  oh  target  first  let  name  baby  step  right  im  going  outside  loop  think  okay  let  name  one  int  target  wait  thought  name  target  okay  alright  thats  created  yeah  said  need  size  okay  copy  first  half  source  array  second  half  alright  shifting  element  might  need  use  see  cant  divided  n  n  length  okay  yeah  yeah  youre  right  wait  thats  right  well  let  make  loop  well  use  like  q  ive  already  used  ive  already  used  really  oh  feel  silly  okay  yeah  okay  working  think  need  new  one  oh  okay  gotcha  alright  loop  weve  got  new  array  want  make  sure  put  youre  right  hows  look  put  right  thing  loop  much  half  length  set  start  wait  yeah  target  set  n  right  equivalent  n  divided  two  good  alright  dont  want  put  first  half  gon  na  set  instead  zero  wait  think  nested  loop  oh  q  greater  set  thing  like  okay  n  want  put  well  say  new  thing  old  thing  right  target  cant  type  q  source  q  feel  like  q  wait  supposed  print  must  want  u  print  im  gon  na  take  print  thing  change  fit  printing  think  new  loop  instead  high  value  want  target  oh  let  see  work  close  right  mmhmm  negative  look  put  second  half  shouldnt  first  three  zero  first  like  seven  zero  yeah  there  number  zero  zero  zero  least  four  rest  number  ive  got  reverse  backwards  zero  two  half  maybe  say  q  le  let  try  nope  better  way  oh  know  changed  made  high  value  thing  didnt  change  maybe  nevermind  alright  clearly  trick  maybe  need  shift  element  yeah  yeah  youve  got  ta  subtract  tried  right  didnt  work  isnt  right  n  length  right  tried  didnt  work  maybe  try  actually  wait  wait  minus  print  dont  understand  ive  got  temp  try  yeah  mean  named  temp  two  fine  think  trying  much  might  something  two  step  like  two  loop  probably  wont  change  anything  maybe  declare  variable  target  dot  length  divided  two  using  target  thought  maybe  needed  use  shifting  element  technique  get  start  zero  yeah  know  thats  okay  let  go  back  let  simplify  right  middle  cant  set  middle  definitely  dont  need  okay  dont  need  one  try  simplify  named  middle  dont  keep  putting  loop  q  q  middle  long  le  middle  see  thats  problem  le  middle  long  le  length  right  dont  really  even  need  well  guess  fine  dont  need  made  complicated  okay  dont  know  yay  working  put  yeah  yeah  run  okay  one  two  three  four  five  yep  look  good  im  gon  na  put  couple  comment  keep  going  oh  gosh  target  okay  want  variable  make  easier  oh  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  divided  two  yeah  rest  look  good  simple  thought  yeah  thats  loop  print  yeah  whole  thing  print  since  array  use  loop  show  everything  yeah  worked  yeah  use  want  okay  thats  cool  print  yeah  dont  know  used  line  might  get  rid  yeah  thats  right  printing  target  b  right  yeah  space  yeah  well  see  work  think  there  problem  previous  loop  okay  oh  target  q  equal  source  q  declare  top  declare  top  whyd  set  maybe  set  length  n  doesnt  say  want  get  confirmation  yeah  guess  im  going  put  comment  yeah  think  put  line  break  earlier  scroll  ill  bet  find  backslash  n  hm  fast  right  yeah  dont  want  make  mistake  yeah  depends  youre  trying  print  mostly  yeah  yeah  yeah  dont  know  doesnt  work  ive  done  something  wrong  oh  okay  right  mean  yeah  source  yeah  wait  listen  print  array  show  number  always  loop  yeah  look  like  right  always  line  different  whatever  going  call  print  inside  yeah  one  want  print  every  time  go  around  right  print  first  one  second  one  right  let  try  ive  got  put  first  first  part  print  statement  need  somewhere  else  otherwise  say  every  time  show  number  need  loop  make  sense  going  pain  though  yeah  wouldnt  write  oh  youre  funny  wait  wait  since  there  inside  loop  want  go  one  lower  outside  full  loop  yeah  right  yeah  yeah  let  see  ive  got  make  sure  put  new  line  end  else  problem  right  need  entire  loop  show  youre  printing  entire  array  keep  line  good  put  loop  around  like  four  int  b  whatever  make  sure  doesnt  go  past  length  array  yeah  source  length  dont  know  yeah  put  end  bracket  print  print  yeah  go  thatll  oh  l  need  say  b  thats  bringing  first  loop  going  bring  first  number  first  number  line  second  loop  going  bring  second  number  first  number  two  second  number  four  itll  print  think  think  right  im  glad  studied  yeah  dont  time  yeah  wouldnt  say  youll  get  hang  yeah  thats  asked  david  supposed  new  loop  every  time  guess  answer  yes  yeah  postlab  prequiz  dont  know  print  new  line  time  maximum  number  problem  dont  even  remember  put  maximum  number  im  problem  showing  extra  line  doesnt  need  oh  right  right  think  oh  im  trying  make  array  right  right  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  maximum  eight  thats  right  average  three  okay  nothing  higher  three  theyve  shuffled  original  array  number  jumbled  look  pretty  good  think  there  many  zero  original  zero  yeah  look  good  whats  problem  thats  good  nine  maximum  number  might  want  put  writing  say  maximum  number  would  right  n  look  good  array  instead  new  line  maybe  space  maybe  instead  saying  print  line  yeah  yeah  thing  discovered  want  write  anything  write  loop  otherwise  itll  tell  many  time  yeah  print  dont  know  let  check  midnight  friday  yeah  look  good  thats  printing  array  array  high  value  thats  good  want  write  anything  though  id  recommend  loop  yeah  mmhmm  affirmative  array  doesnt  really  matter  description  change  line  print  maybe  add  space  number  nice  yeah  itll  look  good  nice  right  youve  got  high  value  still  need  final  shuffled  one  shuffled  one  oh  youre  missing  two  shuffled  one  last  one  yeah  could  probably  copy  loop  going  thing  right  take  whole  two  line  end  bracket  copy  want  change  little  bit  want  yep  look  good  change  name  array  youre  printing  yeah  yeah  wait  doesnt  need  oh  dont  think  need  already  created  loop  youre  calling  still  need  loop  fine  show  working  multiple  one  think  fine  yeah  yeah  yeah  thats  true  im  going  fill  exit  form  working  yeah  working  thats  good  need  make  sure  there  new  line  maybe  yeah  space  yeah  thatll  work  didnt  oh  wait  take  back  think  need  loop  thats  printing  thats  loop  thats  printing  right  dont  think  trial  error  right  wait  wait  minute  oh  know  want  start  new  line  number  array  see  put  right  part  right  yeah  thatll  wow  look  perfect  mean  number  array  different  place  youre  sure  one  youre  maybe  put  comment  go  know  loop  yeah  thats  right  april  whats  number  four  right  ready  right  im  clicking  take  quiz  ready  yeah  time  let  right  yes  okay  yeah  right  match  part  value  array  given  line  dont  understand  oh  yeah  part  one  declaring  array  array  set  new  array  oh  yeah  next  thing  calling

confusing  okay  first  part  comma  youre  calling  string  array  need  put  sort  like  square  bracket  nothing  yeah  okay  could  linear  search  okay  well  need  search  string  let  find  search  mine  oh  youre  right  okay  alright  make  loop  check  key  equal  array  four  great  okay  let  rewatch  video  make  sure  know  see  there  caption  nope  well  see  one  want  think  basically  went  isnt  right  look  like  thats  difference  see  going  one  got  well  thats  basically  right  right  call  bubble  sort  versus  normal  sort  like  selection  sort  oh  comparing  key  wasnt  try  figure  doesnt  key  doesnt  make  sense  right  let  see  understand  question  right  let  code  oh  code  call  swap  method  say  swap  parenthesis  number  oh  havent  checked  havent  read  question  yet  hang  yeah  look  like  selection  sort  doesnt  sorry  guess  problem  im  textbook  didnt  last  page  know  selection  sort  dont  know  bubble  sort  somewhere  copying  erase  way  far  yeah  oh  saying  look  yeah  youre  right  bubble  yeah  oh  thats  right  okay  three  five  going  stay  right  first  row  showing  second  row  show  found  three  le  five  swapped  yeah  going  stay  check  whether  five  two  equal  le  yeah  since  five  greater  two  going  swap  right  going  isnt  right  got  rewatch  video  okay  let  go  back  beginning  oops  thats  right  set  work  slowly  hang  normal  dont  time  oops  okay  fine  five  see  problem  right  still  order  going  go  way  yep  yeah  youre  right  okay  let  go  back  yep  weve  got  three  two  wait  five  eight  changing  yep  yeah  eight  stay  next  row  also  right  three  two  five  eight  yet  havent  gotten  end  weve  got  check  whether  five  eight  bigger  since  five  le  eight  going  stay  spot  swap  think  actually  check  two  check  two  check  two  go  back  beginning  check  two  check  two  go  back  beginning  check  oh  well  value  go  well  dont  know  think  wait  one  yeah  got  number  look  good  well  think  ignore  second  look  number  number  theyre  order  right  first  check  two  three  le  swap  youve  done  next  row  youre  checking  next  two  swap  two  see  two  still  smaller  three  yeah  thats  youve  got  row  next  row  youre  checking  two  swapping  swapping  row  actually  previous  row  thats  think  next  time  start  yeah  yep  would  make  also  think  thats  right  look  like  well  okay  right  one  textbook  yeah  swap  list  wish  list  current  min  index  doesnt  look  like  swap  okay  could  merge  heap  dont  know  enough  weve  already  done  bubble  though  textbook  merge  heap  ive  never  seen  say  answering  question  partner  discus  whole  group  discus  whole  group  oh  well  right  guess  okay  current  min  let  see  look  like  whatd  finish  sixteen  already  right  let  walk  thing  basically  put  smallest  index  think  combination  thing  right  oh  okay  computer  freezing  frozen  reason  cant  scroll  go  right  selection  sort  answer  never  even  heard  two  cant  right  okay  let  recall  mystery  method  using  following  okay  one  go  everything  oh  man  okay  dont  know  look  like  bubble  sort  trick  like  two  thing  exact  thing  okay  think  like  want  really  oh  know  difference  selection  sort  sends  end  doesnt  swap  two  sends  lower  number  thats  right  yeah  okay  think  seven  eight  nine  six  ive  got  next  one  five  done  five  jump  dont  understand  yeah  seems  like  two  step  first  row  second  row  yeah  dont  know  would  like  well  like  took  first  number  placed  fall  order  maybe  next  one  took  first  number  two  didnt  move  still  next  one  guess  would  take  number  two  move  three  wait  took  number  three  didnt  move  next  time  took  number  five  didnt  move  time  eight  would  move  look  good  next  time  theyre  checking  seven  hasnt  moved  eight  yeah  think  going  answer  every  time  last  one  flip  dont  think  check  six  fifth  time  theyre  going  yeah  next  one  also  one  theyre  checking  nine  point  nine  isnt  necessarily  wrong  spot  next  time  theyre  checking  six  put  go  think  mean  could  bubble  sort  think  selection  sort  okay  try  think  idea  doesnt  say  retake  oh  going  show  u  got  wrong  let  study  mistake  first  wait  mean  got  one  wrong  look  like  supposed  compile  error  isnt  order  maybe  would  give  negative  one  binary  search  one  binary  search  number  order  thought  compile  error  maybe  would  return  negative  one  yeah  think  well  say  one  one  point  thats  good  got  one  wrong  maybe  first  one  maybe  there  supposed  three  instead  four  okay  right  thought  said  simplest  answer  truth  wasnt  know  sorry  thats  havent  studied  one  percent  right  though  weve  really  got  thats  good  pretty  well  need  ask  help  section  though  yeah  try  yeah  right  search  search  binary  search  search  one  negative  one  three  binary  search  check  middle  middle  low  check  higher  never  find  would  negative  one  eight  negative  one  nine  third  option  ten  pretty  much  everything  search  try  get  worse  score  count  highest  score  count  okay  let  try  cant  hurt  take  cant  would  cheating  wonder  searching  first  yeah  first  block  code  linear  search  right  yep  return  one  return  negative  one  question  isnt  would  return  found  unit  right  searching  six  one  two  three  yeah  examine  method  binary  search  one  one  wait  minute  negative  one  one  put  compile  error  negative  one  third  option  question  nine  one  think  need  start  three  instead  four  going  give  u  think  smaller  new  variable  equal  two  equal  one  equal  wait  new  high  variable  equal  two  mid  one  maybe  thats  got  wrong  mid  equal  six  think  yeah  equal  key  there  step  eight  wait  made  two  change  isnt  good  think  first  one  still  equal  four  yeah  three  new  high  variable  yeah  right  efficient  binary  search  smallest  first  multiple  neighboring  said  bubble  sort  right  right  let  see  redo  five  wait  three  two  five  eight  three  two  five  eight  three  two  disagree  disagree  yeah  yeah  next  one  also  three  two  five  eight  three  two  five  eight  yeah  three  two  five  eight  last  one  two  three  five  eight  okay  right  one  one  selection  sort  great  got  wrong  im  going  listen  better  think  oh  one  right  yeah  right  okay  right  okay  okay  yeah  oh  middle  okay  two  three  five  eight  wait  problem  example  let  check  last  one  outside  one  outside  one  four  first  need  length  right  user  oh  okay  scanner  yeah  got  make  array  right  use  index  keep  telling  im  something  right  cause  might  make  big  mistake  okay  make  sense  want  plus  one  go  ill  make  eight  maybe  okay  wait  seven  wasnt  plus  two  itd  zero  seven  including  seven  right  want  go  two  seven  include  plus  three  okay  need  eight  gram  cause  range  four  wait  want  number  two  nine  seven  cause  thats  want  plus  two  get  u  two  oh  maybe  need  plus  two  max  think  right  let  try  next  step  okay  oh  already  need  make  array  said  needed  call  something  need  call  mayarray  got  good  okay  thats  im  okay  think  spelling  wait  new  nit  okay  thatll  wonder  still  working  oh  okay  need  fill  random  number  mean  yeah  need  nested  lob  yeah  ever  would  like  thats  mean  kinda  like  done  textbook  row  column  otherwise  going  remember  thing  yeah  oh  like  say  matrix  want  say  main  array  second  one  dont  use  length  one  length  anymore  cause  set  equal  length  rightinaudible  okay  good  length  whole  array  guess  could  way  want  instead  could  length  one  length  two  want  think  thats  set  think  thats  good  logic  yeah  let  way  yes  okay  got  fill  random  number  one  nine  okay  know  im  changing  mind  random  number  top  think  instead  seven  need  eight  cause  want  inclusive  last  number  right  yeah  think  dont  think  three  whats  yeah  thats  wed  plus  one  might  well  write  eight  yeah  keep  hand  finish  well  u  want  int  math  dot  random  time  nine  plus  one  doesnt  start  zero  cause  need  number  one  nine  try  get  come  around  know  length  hard  word  spell  think  might  h  need  swapped  yeah  go  array  array  okay  need  print  array  oh  wanted  get  confirmation  logic  good  math  random  need  number  two  nine  including  eight  right  gon  na  start  zero  dont  put  plus  two  right  need  max  minus  mean  seven  yeah  eight  eight  good  ten  high  okay  thank  minus  min  plus  one  plus  whatever  min  right  good  let  try  yeah  nice  yeah  know  think  gon  na  need  nested  loop  order  yeah  number  b  wait  havent  done  b  yet  gon  na  b  yeah  gon  na  need  two  loop  though  dont  use  text  yeah  sound  good  yeah  gon  na  want  print  end  bracket  one  yeah  look  good  take  back  thought  already  done  dont  need  last  row  writing  gon  na  print  yeah  yeah  actually  printing  value  intersection  two  index  printing  whats  yeah  look  great  last  bracket  end  closed  one  oh  youre  missing  one  think  need  another  maybe  two  yeah  thats  better  right  im  gon  na  go  right  next  two  end  bracket  put  oh  printing  yeah  yeah  let  run  see  happens  isnt  good  need  format  differently  need  print  think  hey  howd  okay  let  try  thats  nice  isnt  right  though  cause  number  one  nine  oh  okay  thats  good  whatever  random  number  think  ended  six  time  print  itll  different  size  okay  yeah  onesinaudible  thats  satisfying  okay  yes  thank  okay  c  calculate  average  number  column  look  cause  gon  na  calculate  average  later  double  right  let  start  nit  okay  right  need  add  together  first  mean  wait  first  number  total  gon  na  go  im  hand  loop  oh  like  counter  sum  end  sum  equal  zero  well  dont  average  yet  yeah  late  oh  okay  well  hows  youre  thinking  order  im  thinking  order  good  yeah  yes  said  calculate  average  column  column  everything  way  basically  except  total  sum  yeah  think  gon  na  adapt  think  need  cause  always  gon  na  zero  right  cause  thats  first  one  gon  na  go  opposed  oh  sum  plus  equal  yeah  look  good  yeah  right  great  yeah  weve  already  got  average  say  average  equal  sum  yeah  youre  right  dont  even  need  divide  well  im  length  print  yeah  yeah  probably  describe  know  printing  oh  supposed  calculate  average  number  column  need  double  loop  need  average  every  number  want  wait  average  column  average  number  guess  misread  thought  said  calculate  average  number  first  column  mean  every  column  need  make  check  every  variable  think  one  like  together  like  average  every  column  cause  say  print  average  column  average  include  digit  decimal  point  yeah  let  add  part  middle  line  cause  thats  skipped  thought  didnt  need  im  changing  row  okay  yeah  yeah  row  right  okay  know  right  okay  okay  wait  think  outer  loop  length  one  inner  loop  length  two  here  ive  changed  yeah  length  one  say  matrix  using  yeah  column  row  okay  oh  know  yeah  sound  like  wait  minute  uh  oh  divided  length  two  anymore  divided  length  two  time  length  one  right  get  every  number  im  gon  na  okay  got  yeah  might  put  parenthesis  around  two  division  great  let  test  well  make  sense  whatd  get  thats  great  im  notso  else  need  find  maximum  oh  gosh  find  maximum  average  print  mean  method  method  oh  cause  length  dot  something  thats  fine  right  wait  need  print  decimal  though  end  need  double  include  okay  let  worry  maximum  average  value  okay  need  find  wait  minute  mean  maximum  average  want  bunch  different  average  shoot  right  needed  column  yeah  think  theyre  yeah  like  look  column  one  two  plus  four  plus  five  divided  three  three  six  plus  six  plus  two  need  actually  separate  loop  actually  good  yeah  need  make  bunch  different  average  column  think  said  length  method  dont  think  think  get  let  put  zero  say  row  see  okay  always  gon  na  start  zero  right  index  number  index  number  gon  na  go  one  two  three  every  single  time  know  stop  instead  four  loop  stop  blank  right  yeah  yeah  agree  yeah  think  dont  need  inner  loop  sorry  instead  column  row  column  row  column  column  yeah  let  yeahmine  right  column  first  angel  need  column  going  right  yeah  thats  good  column  would  zero  first  time  good  right  would  two  three  four  till  end  many  column  need  figure  first  want  next  time  want  plus  one  want  go  slowly  right  go  real  slowly  fast  thing  go  like  need  another  loop  outside  separated  got  one  number  want  average  every  single  column  well  okay  let  way  like  getting  average  one  first  column  right  need  go  need  get  mean  could  right  maybe  change  right  zero  thats  good  idea  let  gon  na  take  whole  thing  put  lower  dont  know  gon  na  need  yeah  right  im  gon  na  put  space  see  properly  okay  know  think  need  put  average  back  outside  okay  bring  sum  didnt  okay  ill  take  back  remember  length  yeah  okay  change  length  main  array  dot  length  cause  didnt  bring  length  one  unless  want  dot  length  calling  average  thought  okay  thats  fine  put  maybe  put  index  something  put  index  put  index  instead  zero  great  lower  length  bracket  dont  want  want  index  need  declare  outside  loop  mean  outside  method  wont  okay  let  figure  weve  done  thisand  want  go  right  yeah  okay  okay  called  yeah  know  need  make  index  go  think  need  like  outside  im  gon  na  take  gon  na  weve  got  actually  let  put  oh  gosh  okay  need  limp  could  probably  put  method  dont  think  well  make  result  hows  well  say  cant  use  length  two  isnt  good  cant  use  length  two  isnt  good  either  think  bring  length  two  well  change  main  array  dot  length  length  two  easier  think  line  one  refers  far  across  row  want  get  far  might  reversed  well  find  return  average  whats  one  higher  okay  need  loop  maybe  wild  loop  maybe  yeah  yeah  let  see  work  oh  wait  havent  called  cant  say  average  anymore  call  method  call  average  put  thing  yeah  two  index  okay  im  gon  na  test  see  go  oops  well  dont  know  still  written  average  ball  column  really  average  first  column  okay  oh  sorry  let  try  oh  thats  easy  average  okay  ive  got  length  reversed  think  need  think  need  change  length  two  method  bring  length  one  instead  okay  let  see  bad  think  minus  one  let  try  probably  need  minus  one  let  try  oh  man  cant  calculate  nine  five  three  five  seven  seven  one  there  many  number  wait  one  two  three  okay  four  thats  bad  wait  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  column  there  one  two  three  four  five  six  printed  another  plat  maybe  didnt  need  one  need  one  see  printed  twice  average  one  isnt  right  two  plus  eight  ten  divided  two  five  average  five  well  yeah  switched  length  one  length  thats  weird  yeah  see  one  didnt  get  error  would  sometimes  give  error  sometimes  oh  must  something  wrong  random  number  isnt  good  thing  cycling  getting  index  first  time  zero  one  also  zero  next  time  one  two  three  time  call  method  calling  loop  maybe  thats  problem  cant  call  loop  dont  know  wait  yeah  think  might  random  number  maybe  need  back  seven  let  try  seven  row  okayinaudible  using  length  one  row  length  two  column  maybe  need  length  two  length  two  one  ran  length  one  length  two  let  try  one  two  three  four  five  oh  im  counting  wrong  way  one  two  three  four  five  go  one  two  three  four  five  time  think  getting  average  row  instead  column  five  divided  five  would  like  something  okay  thats  want  try  five  seven  five  five  seven  one  six  eight  eight  five  divided  eight  yeah  dont  know  number  doesnt  match  average  happens  dont  use  line  instead  increment  average  three  divided  five  three  three  thats  good  yeah  divided  five  weve  got  question  another  time  loop  kind  loop  need  maybe  try  four  loop  okay  cant  hurt  right  cant  use  index  might  thing  se  there  three  column  oh  blank  two  sorry  maybe  without  minus  one  sorry  one  two  count  like  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eighth  one  two  three  four  five  six  dont  minus  one  anymore  take  why  showing  u  two  like  whole  thing  averaging  row  instead  column  maybe  need  column  side  oh  make  sense  thats  probably  changing  one  back  forth  cause  cant  figure  yeah  definitely  need  minus  one  yeah  right  yeah  oh  well  least  one  right  thing  one  column  two  one  got  ta  column  one  right  cause  counting  many  number  column  gon  na  need  call  wait  red  though  one  two  three  four  five  one  two  three  four  five  getting  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  okay  good  try  random  number  good  changed  right  sorry  bad  yeah  sometimes  sometimes  okay  got  loop  calling  loop  method  might  looping  many  time  theyre  top  oh  know  shouldnt  using  index  counter  index  thing  could  use  going  making  range  get  smaller  make  sense  let  see  fix  okay  thanks  think  figured  cause  way  making  go  making  go  oh  le  oops  problem  turned  opposite  way  graded  four  right  say  method  get  twodimensional  array  input  count  average  element  second  one  yeah  youre  right  reminder  assignment  three  due  two  day  april  th  th  itll  fine  yeah  call  like  display  maybe  display  array  maybe  okay  yeah  twodimensional  got  two  empty  space  thing  here  ive  got  far  store  input  something  put  array  instead  zero  would  whatever  call  like  say  want  seven  row  whatever  calling  answer  well  put  yeah  okay  yeah  oh  yeah  could  im  going  leave  mine  um  array  thats  called  mine  say  turn  twodimensional  ride  main  method  create  method  think  write  number  want  like  say  enter  many  number  well  store  yeah  right  point  weve  done  created  empty  array  zero  location  weve  asked  big  want  havent  put  anything  feel  like  way  move  forward  ask  put  number  yeah  yeah  yeah  used  like  dont  think  going  run  without  error  book  sure  mean  remember  exercise  book  didnt  work  yeah  thats  probably  good  yeah  thats  length  yeah  okay  right  anything  enter  youre  fine  dont  think  dont  think  good  though  first  asked  length  column  row  oh  let  try  one  time  make  sure  right  track  loop  oh  nothing  dunno  main  total  going  there  problem  though  need  get  user  input  least  length  method  right  method  return  array  cant  print  array  right  wed  know  loop  cant  know  long  set  loop  dont  know  number  going  ask  length  outside  method  okay  like  instead  stuff  deleted  said  return  array  order  print  wed  say  system  got  wed  also  put  loop  right  doesnt  work  tried  mean  give  length  enter  number  everything  going  print  right  need  loop  lot  ill  get  didnt  think  see  entered  number  cant  print  maybe  ask  thing  earlier  passed  left  let  take  first  five  row  part  okay  thats  good  sign  probably  right  need  actually  going  passing  number  right  n  n  sorry  else  oh  yeah  nice  input  next  thats  good  oh  thats  right  fix  yeah  youre  right  thats  needed  okay  instead  getarray  need  put  around  loop  right  isnt  good  yeah  mean  weve  got  length  array  cant  oh  could  put  n  comma  n  yeah  might  need  one  loop  let  test  didnt  work  dont  creation  display  okay  let  okay  move  right  move  lot  move  lot  take  everything  except  return  right  well  double  loop  putting  number  array  length  already  number  inside  array  think  need  display  think  mean  cant  ever  display  display  send  answer  yes  calculate  average  right  sorry  okay  get  lens  okay  oh  got  equal  say  oops  j  make  another  loop  thats  j  sound  good  print  line  right  getarray  longer  need  right  long  return  im  using  showed  yeah  yeah  yeah  right  right  look  good  real  problem  left  there  problem  let  try  problem  trying  save  oops  forgot  put  print  line  would  right  okay  two  row  three  column  theory  oh  yeah  good  let  yeah  mean  youve  got  get  length  main  otherwise  wont  know  use  print  right  good  thing  said  extra  line  extra  print  line  going  stuck  didnt  know  thats  funny  oh  next  thing  going  average  weve  got  average  method  soon  yeah  fine  im  going  youve  got  finish  fore  loop  think  yeah  youre  good  wait  method  think  youre  auto  pilot  little  bit  instead  want  method  printed  declare  like  set  value  okay  yeah  put  one  higher  set  call  yeah  twodimensional  yeah  use  yeah  yeah  j  put  space  yeah  youve  got  wait  look  fine  need  go  back  havent  declared  array  something  like  insarray  equal  yeah  line  well  way  figure  creating  one  method  assigning  new  name  outside  method  like  main  method  yeah  youre  good  beginning  row  line  higher  higher  higher  right  need  say  array  thatll  fix  okay  let  get  average  okay  let  make  new  method  call  method  yeah  didnt  work  doesnt  seem  like  would  work  maybe  need  call  wait  yeah  put  right  okay  doesnt  look  like  yeah  could  problem  let  stuff  middle  yeah  let  two  four  loop  sum  okay  ill  worry  part  later  im  putting  loop  wrong  im  holding  hang  okay  let  keep  going  im  sure  yet  figured  wed  go  back  get  later  dont  know  im  right  okay  ill  slow  youre  right  maybe  need  array  think  called  working  put  instead  array  work  j  doesnt  work  take  back  getting  sum  first  going  use  get  average  yeah  right  sum  divided  oops  first  going  calculate  average  turn  average  set  sum  equal  zero  dont  need  youre  saying  datatype  right  least  giving  error  okay  click  okay  well  well  figured  length  entire  cough  going  really  loud  thing  test  there  problem  need  make  sure  main  method  yeah  well  put  average  average  okay  n  comma  n  yeah  brought  n  n  oh  thats  better  right  im  testing  ah  didnt  work  oh  wait  work  take  back  work  didnt  tell  last  thing  average  yeah  thats  prompt  said  right  oh  sorry  let  see  need  make  print  yeah  nice  thatll  work  scroll  yeah  look  good  sum  divided  thats  ive  got  okay  scroll  little  there  error  oh  keep  going  maybe  there  many  bracket  somewhere  look  fine  scroll  could  youre  thing  okay  whats  line  right  intarray  well  come  youve  got  ive  got  way  method  intarray  getarray  yeah  make  sure  getarray  method  scroll  look  yeah  look  good  there  okay  wonder  didnt  give  error  okay  exception  main  wait  let  see  ive  got  yeah  wait  scroll  back  second  look  good  right  let  start  bottom  weve  got  literally  thing  mine  working  mmhmm  affirmative  mmhmm  affirmative  oh  youve  got  set  n  change  first  one  n  right  yay  let  part  yeah  put  comment  later  thought  said  dont  put  pseudocomments  okay  write  program  search  character  twodimensional  array  need  define  method  creates  twodimensional  array  userdefined  size  close  array  random  character  also  instead  filling  user  input  filling  random  character  character  number  weve  got  character  still  think  take  pretty  much  adapt  start  new  file  dont  want  lose  oh  okay  make  sure  title  saved  going  go  change  type  array  character  right  okay  oh  think  start  scratch  character  think  let  try  work  step  step  yeah  actually  character  array  need  make  integer  array  convert  random  character  declare  character  array  right  okay  okay  okay  im  calling  array  right  need  use  method  wonder  yeah  moved  last  line  method  seems  like  go  put  array  n  n  like  method  n  n  right  set  oh  wait  let  use  hows  going  generate  random  character  wish  chapter  yeah  dont  even  know  start  wait  might  actually  book  well  find  yeah  think  recent  one  actually  maybe  seven  youre  right  might  chapter  like  mean  char  oh  okay  thats  good  need  another  loop  though  need  two  nested  loop  since  working  twodimensional  array  yeah  thats  good  wont  show  alphabet  oh  printed  number  though  convert  unicode  yeah  mean  think  answer  right  need  converted  back  oh  hey  make  random  yeah  make  sense  okay  u  nice  u  two  loop  put  random  thing  right  let  together  yeah  might  wait  minute  still  going  loop  well  later  whyd  one  im  zero  cant  thats  true  right  going  array  j  equal  random  thing  right  math  dot  random  wait  char  youd  int  first  right  z  minus  range  plus  minimum  right  right  wait  range  max  minus  min  plus  one  right  think  int  first  working  yeah  im  bunch  parenthesis  yeah  yeah  outside  plus  minus  yep  put  semicolon  end  open  parenthesis  math  right  think  need  make  sure  remember  call  havent  called  ive  gotten  return  havent  made  print  needed  two  four  loop  yeah  think  wait  supposed  dont  know  dont  need  ask  character  need  make  another  method  search  character  okay  cant  let  see  theyll  always  win  game  yeah  thats  printing  yeah  called  right  gosh  hope  work  wait  okay  getting  close  getting  close  work  yeah  im  going  test  oh  worked  got  wrong  character  probably  yeah  oh  made  worse  changed  instead  plus  arent  lowercase  character  think  need  change  range  maybe  need  parenthesis  mean  working  got  issue  needed  parenthesis  around  z  whyd  erase  whole  thing  think  would  good  change  narrative  think  youre  smart  yeah  let  anymore  outside  plus  safe  yeah  okay  somethings  different  oh  good  sorry  look  good  right  let  make  one  method  well  done  wait  let  try  okay  thats  good  plus  okay  wait  got  rid  one  still  dont  get  z  could  chance  let  try  oh  got  yeah  good  didnt  get  z  one  still  get  maybe  needed  minus  one  okay  wait  dont  get  rid  outside  okay  minus  one  doesnt  work  yeah  better  like  really  need  z  plus  one  oh  yeah  thats  nice  get  z  think  figured  need  z  plus  one  minus  dont  okay  let  try  nope  thats  z  plus  whats  half  z  well  plus  one  either  let  try  try  one  time  there  z  might  need  two  plus  one  yeah  let  try  let  see  happens  oh  worse  better  four  yeah  recited  mine  okay  hang  right  im  following  said  five  nine  doesnt  matter  yeah  um  okay  way  yeah  thats  dont  know  know  gon  na  loop  like  first  loop  well  everything  happens  within  big  loop  there  smaller  loop  inside  sure  like  set  two  loop  gon  na  print  right  think  like  okay  let  go  back  let  start  loop  like  press  enter  command  maybe  itll  work  know  hey  worked  fast  never  pressed  enter  yeah  exclusive  yeah  look  good  okay  need  get  user  input  think  there  trick  like  need  say  printed  without  pressing  enter  right  like  never  pressed  anything  like  dont  know  really  okay  oh  got  put  inputnextline  thats  yeah  work  oh  um  counter  first  loop  second  number  random  number  index  like  right  mine  look  like  yeah  think  made  easy  u  huh  made  easy  u  told  u  rush  well  yeah  there  mystery  anymore  yeah  okay  dont  forget  since  twodimensional  array  youre  gon  na  two  loop  around  print  statement  yeah  always  cause  right  youre  gon  na  two  index  number  dont  anything  yeah  make  two  loop  yeah  used  k  q  dont  know  could  try  row  row  second  move  column  second  one  got  ta  yeah  okay  fine  print  dont  forget  gon  na  need  another  print  line  yeah  like  taught  would  press  stop  see  there  anything  missing  even  second  print  line  think  one  higher  yeah  wonder  wasnt  working  could  computer  think  computer  want  space  inbetween  quotation  mark  okay  maybe  thatll  work  oh  press  enter  nice  good  never  like  said  press  enter  user  like  yeah  line  little  tired  oh  part  youre  prompting  say  enter  wont  put  first  loop  like  take  part  way  thing  outside  loop  declaration  cause  want  ask  yeah  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  pretty  much  okay  yay  wait  minute  come  four  row  oh  set  one  set  zero  beginning  need  set  loop  zero  well  youre  okay  right  nice  nine  across  look  like  gon  na  put  one  row  mmhmm  affirmative  start  first  could  anywhere  row  hopefully  need  checking  see  theyve  part  yeah  like  two  yeah  first  need  boolean  variable  figure  whether  yeah  yeah  um  yeah  statement  go  inside  second  loop  basically  gon  na  two  loop  instead  printing  well  instead  set  five  nine  set  nine  five  swap  oh  need  h  need  b  basically  like  need  old  loop  swapping  length  cause  thats  equivalent  nine  top  five  bottom  well  else  youre  using  j  okay  yeah  swap  yeah  matrix  called  array  wan  na  make  set  like  use  counter  inner  loop  first  part  counter  outer  loop  second  instead  zero  zero  inner  loop  one  yeah  yeah  look  good  yeah  look  good  bracket  yeah  close  yeah  last  thing  make  little  else  statement  print  whether  lost  called  array  scroll  second  int  array  oh  know  dont  know  oh  equal  instead  like  making  new  assignment  yeah  need  sort  else  show  whether  theyve  yeah  right  well  key  boolean  right  true  false  okay  yeah  im  gon  na  put  comment  second  working  youre  winner  worked  wonder  many  time  try  win  addicting  huh  dont  know  think  working  fine  though  question  thats  really  wanted  know  could  make  array  way  smaller  like  let  test  cause  mine  right  ill  make  three  four  hows  set  four  okay  let  try  well  mean  improbable  program  isnt  oh  close  time  let  try  one  time  oh  fun  fun  oh  get  one  column  yeah  yeah  thats  okay  though  guess  im  trying  write  comment  make  sure  okay  okay  okay  okay  wan  na  exit  form  pseudo  code  laugh  working  okay  let  see  oh  grade  he  updated  grade  dont  wan  na  see  okay  let  exit  form  instead  catch  train  oh  click  title  uh  wait  second  thinking  wait  okay  top  yeah  um  logged  look  like  logged  like  logged  different  email  account  yeah  switch  user  switch  one  school  account  yeah  okay  taking

think this is right  well i mean i didnt know if it has to be but in the assignment sheet  inaudible   no but like you see how it says inaudible  that has this inaudible  says this but then down here inaudible  run sampler it shows this right  oh it doesnt say it has to be capitalized inaudible  correct  whatever this is  whats the zero mean  why its one inaudible   so when youre trying to take the users input it doesnt matter whether its capitalized or not  but like does that matter  i have a question  oh okay fine inaudible   this is for assignment two but do the users input have to be

inaudible  put it on your shirt bro inaudible  put it on your shirt  yo there she goes inaudible  like oh my god  but yeah bro he grew my brother grew  like   we had different dads  i mean he plays jv  no but they gave him fucking inaudible  merchandise  yeah  true  inaudible   inaudible   or uncc inaudible   you all went to state  what inaudible   wheres that at  whered engram  go  put it on my shirt  cant do it  inaudible   but no the doctor said my brothers supposed to be like   i was like  because hes   hes like   hes a stick though he be walking like this  its like you need to get in the weight room  his arms are skinnier than mine  robert brokowski  or something  ive known about that dude for a while  he doesnt play for the team  yeah he just goes to school works out with them  all right lets get this done we have nothing  inaudible  how to write methods i might write methods  yeah its easy its like  so to do like a method you got to do like  inaudible  so inaudible   yeah inaudible  yeah so youd be like  yeah  its just whatever you want to put in the method  yeah  and then you inaudible  so its like being like all right so i want to put inaudible  you get thats actually what its supposed inaudible   its just yeah so this is your main method right here so all of the methods that you call go in the main method  say like  say like i want to make a rectangle method right so i do like whats the area of a rectangle so you do like n im going to do double double length equals   just to demonstrate it and then double width is  and then you do a system dot out dot print line see and then you go and then you print out length times width inaudible  then this when you call rectangle up here  and run it and its going to print out the answer  and then just crosstalk   yeah  yeah look at this if i delete this its not going to do anything  what is that  okay so in this activity you will write a program that prompts the user to enter a shape and its dimension inaudible  look like inaudible   i have questions  nevermind  ill just do it the way i want  i just did program one  you said what  like a what  rectangle triangle circle  yo  what do we need for a square we just need one side right  times four  crosstalk   okay but we just need the length of one side  okay  inaudible   where at  okay  a capital letter where why do you have to put in a capital letter  i used switch statement so that if you dont put anyone in tell them tell them on the thing in quotation marks make sure its capital and then if its not capital its going to come back and youll be able to put them back up to the main method thats what i did with my first assignment i used methods like this david thought i cheated because i was using methods but thats the only thing i actually knew how to do and he was like but basically if its not right you can pull them back up to the thing instead of the whole thing just crashing  mmhmm affirmative  yep  yep  it just means the first character and this look at that now put it in so wait let me see  and thats a character there  i dont think so you can make it capital so its always capital  yeah itll matter its case sensitive  i just told you  nevermind ask him  crosstalk   oh my god look at this bro look at this bro this is what hes talking about  a uml  its a big flow chart whatever all right lets finish this  i already did the square one  basically youre basically just writing mini programs in this and then organizing it over here  i didnt understand anything because i think i heard them say inaudible   inaudible  david  i havent seen that man in like three weeks  for the assignment does it matter if we use if statements or a switch statement  okay inaudible  she said inaudible  because its better yeah  just because  no am i tripping oh yeah  uhuh negative oh its u ua  is it its ua  yes  because you probably spelled square somewhere else wrong  because thats a semicolon not a colon  hold on hold on inaudible   inaudible  circle  do you have to make it capital inaudible   nevermind inaudible   inaudible  chill  bro you never created your square method so it doesnt know what that is hm  no no no theres the main method that organizes everything were doing right here and then theres separate methods that you call  name mmhmm affirmative are you talking about square  because i have square created  like if you went down here outside of the method and you did public static void square  no  yeah because you still want to be in the class  how do you find the area of a circle is it inaudible  thats right  how do you spell radius hm  inaudible  square inaudible  there you go see it went away  yes  bro you been spelling square wrong for how old are you     jesus  after spring break it gets bad  only a month  youre inaudible   how the hell do you do square  times the radius times the radius  you cant put crosstalk   you dont have to do that thats hard isnt it pi day  stop  where  oh were about to be done  look at that look at this so circle i want a circle inaudible  choice oh you know what i didnt do i didnt call it back to the main method itll correct me okay if i did something wrong itll be like all right thats not something and itll make me put inaudible  inaudible  radius four let me make sure thats right hey thats right kind of now we just need to do rectangle and triangle triangles hard  oh yeah youre right  inaudible  inaudible   oh your homie out  we got two minutes left  i want to do this at home and you do the flow chart  foreign language  are we  all right all right  no were  no i was im not done  i was moving it  inaudible  freshman  no this is a rectangle  yep bro i got to wake up early tomorrow  okay that should be done now i just have to try it  we still need the flow chart  all right inaudible  all right so what do you mean for a triangle  what do you mean though like what inaudible  variables  what is this  yeah but why is that height crosstalk   oh  like that  lets see  hold on  inaudible  whats the base  inaudible  five inaudible  six the base is five  inaudible  six   inaudible   yeah  oh wait we have another one  inaudible  method which checks inaudible  number is odd or even  we did it before you just basically do modulus two and if its equal to zero its even if its not its odd  but why is it so for the second program its asking us to get odd or even but what does it want us to do with the method  inaudible  first part  ill ask chris ill ask chris  chris does too kind of  inaudible   crosstalk  for the second one it wants us to see if the numbers are odd or even but what does it want us to do with the method  but like  i know that but you can do that in just the main method  so what you just do it in a separate method and just call it in the main method  do you have to do that  like that  the method gets an integer of the parameter crosstalk   crosstalk  okay  hold up i think i know how to do it not you talking to inaudible   bro did she oh shes right there i thought she left without her recorder  yeah  give me one second im going to go see what inaudible  doing  i didnt  what  wheres the inaudible  dont give that shit back to me  done  six all right uh no dont do that theyre fine yeah just put it online there you go youre welcome yeah okay hope you got that too oh the answer yeah aw i wish i had my textbook wha what are you talking about theres a textbook online oh well i mean i got it for  bucks so its not that great forever i just dont come to class sometimes so truther  doesnt

click but like right click look at it in the book thats the one thing i wish mac  had crosstalk   huh what no dude i dont know what this is  id say binary because lineal search you could do one or you could do however long the array is but binary search youre always going to do seven circuits or if you just want to be lazy more efficient i guess yeah inaudible  yo david david thank you david david i dont know what this is yeah bro inaudible  still checking the whatever did you see westbrooke  twenty twenty twenty inaudible  hey ask her about the thing  oh thats for the case study what the hell

thought two oh no no no oh so just cut off the mid one okay look at you smart guy  yeah ill take that i couldve done that i was going to read it who the fuck reads it they told us the answer its like is it this one no  no no no  yeah just do that okay i have no idea how to do sorting  group me or text he literally said he got his girlfriend to do it it might whatd you get does this thing happen where your inaudible   look them up oh create huh four and five uh inaudible  one and negative one oh wait wait wait youre taking cap right liar thats what i asked you oh youre a freshman  no oh youre a freshman you take cap oh its basically raw game its hard to explain  it dropped it its binary whos this guy  this guy just walked in here  he looks familiar he looks familiar  does this look like a david lie to us david what do you guys do then is this the only assignment for today david lied to us man he said there was more than this were computer science students yeah i dont sorting is whats  oh you guys got all of them whats second oh okay pull up  pull up  do you guys use sorting in  so what do you do why are we learning it okay yeah okay what is a merge sort what is that inaudible  do you have that problem where this doesnt update so this its charging but its at  and its not updating so i turn up as soon as i turn it back on itll be at  its not showing me the nevermind i do have a

them in order the bubble bro oh the two or the five then it starts at eight now oh no yes so thats two three five eight so it starts at three no okay yeah yeah yeah  inaudible  man what the fuck i learned this like four years ago i took ap computer science in high school my junior year but my teacher sucked im pretty sure almost like  percent of this class has taken some sort of coding class before im part of that  percent crosstalk  i just lookup youtube videos youtube videos i learn by example what are you doing please dont break that please crosstalk  i thought you were picking up the brick but these things are like  davids stepping all over your wire though hey bro hey david get off my wire please these things are fucking  the wires themselves okay im going to show you now because

the random numbers  yeah thats  no random integers we did that right  you take your array so like crosstalk  im in array all right do you have to put that then crosstalk   okay so you have to do  yeah  no  number with the declared value goes on the left side crosstalk  yep you got to populate you crosstalk  thats the size one  i dont know dude crosstalk   no no she said were doing two four groups because crosstalk  morgan sos sos crosstalk  were lost on an island crosstalk  im stuck how do i fill my main array  okay so i have this for a loop  for the what  okay how would i do that  from two to  right add two to nine  yeah  yeah  okay so crosstalk  okay im lost im still lost crosstalk   and im going to make  j crosstalk   oh my god i love this guy im going up with that crosstalk  he declared some time before you crosstalk   crosstalk  is it because actually im not supposed to say crosstalk   yes  can i see your co part crosstalk  see the first part  so what does this do  oh okay so this it putting the rows and columns this is  making numbers in the rows in columns like in the boxes  oh crosstalk  and then how would you print it  light squaring crosstalk  okay  oh  okay got it crosstalk   okay  theres new colors what colors crosstalk   theres not new colors theres not new colors he lied  theres not new colors theyre still white  it said rumor i saw a link that said rumor

i recently found out crosstalk  okay thats how it works all right crosstalk  im getting there  how come its not letting me make a square like you crosstalk  hello crosstalk  no really im trying crosstalk  even trying to use crosstalk  with it mmhmm affirmative thats a method this type of rectangles gonna read that its gonna go to that right okay oh okay crosstalk  use a crosstalk  man would i just  is it easier to use a switch than use a crosstalk  can i use it for crosstalk  is all this in the main yeah why is inaudible  crosstalk  like this method okay okay oh okay mmhmm affirmative you have to decode this scanner for each one crosstalk  instead of mmhmm affirmative you just choose whatever you choose right here and then it just goes to that and you just leave everything mmhmm affirmative crosstalk  kind of like organize them better mmhmm affirmative crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  sometimes its just mainly used to organize crosstalk  mmhmm affirmative yeah yeah crosstalk  is it the right way though the way inaudible  actually crosstalk  for that the spatial code did the packer  dude give it to you do you know it okay okay its the same loop right from packet  cause i clicked on it and it looks like the  yeah so why is it two different dates why is it one on the th and then one of the th like tomorrow because i did the whole thing but i was i supposed to do part of it yeah was i supposed to do oh i printed it out yeah and then i didnt hand it over yet i have it in my bag but  okay cause this is for packet  and packet   i thought it was two different things cause theres special reason packet  and then theres this one yeah but isnt it all this these are all the okay all eight right all eight okay well can i just bring in the okay alright was the second one easier oh okay you can go mmhmm affirmative really how do you get it to inaudible  its not okay so inaudible  square inaudible  i hope so you dont like your methods methods both everything solid all that work inaudible  why am i starting off with inaudible  i dont know inaudible  just clip it on to you can wrap it around your neck or something there you go no what the hell thats crazy i think this is a trick question i know oh my goodness what the fuck oh goddammit no i cant afford to take a zero you could damn is it thats terrible i think its argument thank god i switched it what thats crazy man she didnt like the first one somehow why is it giving me this error question so are we asking them to enter a string in the main method and then making the next method and then just inaudible  the input from there mmhmm affirmative okay and then were running the loop in the next method oh okay me neither thats crazy mmhmm affirmative yeah aaron dude im going to have to figure this out later yeah i got some help im going to have to hop on google or something ill see you man too bad i havent even  im just going to hand it to him alright catch you later man seven thats crazy what kind of vehicles are those  thats crazy damn  i see the music the soundtrack caught me off guard yeah yeah yeah i just inaudible  it was like array dot and length how old are you now it is a long ass time man you had the mic on what inaudible  dont tell me you forgot already inaudible  thats what i did and it went away yep it didnt work uhhuh is it then gonna be zero to nine is it just one less was it displaying your random maybe inaudible  between zero and nine the next inaudible  all right are you gettin this here mmhmm affirmative mmhmm affirmative whatever term its at huh alright i need to double this the  in the  is this all in the same multiple did you make yours all in the same method the average   making  the new array with the average uhhuh affirmative basically what you do is you calculate the average by doing a length that ones not really the end of the world mmhmm affirmative are they the same array you make two different arrays cause you want a way to calculate the average and then the next step  so you dont have to make a new array to calculate the average but the next step is transfer the values that are higher than the average into a new array  for d right using like a b and  i mean the same array for a b and c yeah but im just trying to get an average and divided by the length so for d you made a new array thats why you made array two easier to read oh snap im about to miss my ride please i mean i understand some most of it  yeah do you want me to bring this to you would you want me to bring this to you i dont imagine inaudible  like they said next week were doing this inaudible  image inaudible  and the very first trail they get inaudible  the one with all the weird inaudible  the models d models and stuff yeah got to be good all right ill see you tomorrow all right keep inaudible  seven you want to maybe put them in your backpack or whatever so whatd she say crosstalk  what if the sting inaudible  to the string also inaudible  seven and eight are like if you look at the middle option theyre hovering over right now all right scroll up whats mystery method so i see two mystery methods whats mystery method but which one is the crosstalk  mystery method did that shouldve crosstalk  do you want thomas to turn off the light i didnt want to say whether or not crosstalk  all the question why do i find all the errors in this i find like every single one i know right the worst type thats convenient crosstalk  or something mmhmm affirmative mm what one two three you said youre missing lot of code thats what i put what are you doing this crosstalk  im so used to it so i inaudible  crosstalk  five and fourths crosstalk  mmhmm affirmative mmhmm affirmative seven  so we have some low positive for  it shows it on the page  yeah number two shows initializing at random values then they put the risk for the loop for the row of columns yes  i like you all value efficiency mr that should tag the linear what the hell what the heck its like what  no yeah pretty much  seven  maybe inaudible  mmhmm affirmative what are you trying to do the  that wont even print its running even when you print anything thats all i did too oh so its hey whats crosstalk  i close in zero crosstalk  this is inaudible  really its been really good it makes it crosstalk  so when i break it down from the top crosstalk  how come mine keeps crosstalk  like zero zero every time what the heck okay getting that for crosstalk  okay and the same thing for the next one its going to do like n mmhmm affirmative so didnt we do nine between oh one and nine mmhmm affirmative so one five minus one eight plus one nine inside the loop mmhmm affirmative oops mmhmm affirmative so its going to figure out  why is it still printing zero mmhmm affirmative should i get rid of  does that matter i did put the  this is making the array random it wont fill it mmhmm affirmative this one right here whys this printing zeroes its making array but it wont fill it because he has pretty much the same thing as  hes just filling does he have two things here what is this he just picked random random algorithm eight oh one to nine i think its one thats another way to generate random numbers inaudible  checking it from inaudible  and you got to change that to a nine cut it off where she wont hook you up crosstalk  coming in should interest come in d array then they say you did that and you say in class d arrays hopefully this inaudible  will inaudible  them ill press a button  i know its going to be a long night what were you doing at  am you still got to inaudible  seven how are you doin it seem to be working pretty hard at the at the  cant even hear me  why if it works i dont see the problem  oh yeah that is crazy  so are you asking for the user input in the second method oh so you did it you just had the main method as one so are you taking the user input in the for loop in the  okay ascii i have no clue  you just tryin to do it a different way or something  next line output is giving me this error saying cant covert into boolean  yeah you were saying what yeah i had row right there  rows less than oh okay okay thank you  when did a start at   shit so after you take the user input do you have to create a separate for loop for the sum of the elements and getting the average in a separate method pretty much everything you know im just not understanding how  so you have the main method you did that with one line to get  so were gonna just take the input at first from there  okay yeah  so you dont have to fill that with int a  oh okay so this passing that to that i thought they were doing that right here thats why im confused   okay so im returning that to the main okay but what array is it using is it just using a random thing  so you add to the array oh so we use that one which is that okay you can like plug that one  okay  appreciate it im just gonna do that yeah gettin it  yeah that helped for sure alright tomorrow morning  okay its cool yeah he was gone,recently  found  okay  thats  work  right  im  getting  come  letting  make  square  like  hello  really  im  trying  even  trying  use  mmhmm  affirmative  thats  method  type  rectangle  gon  na  read  gon  na  go  right  okay  oh  okay  use  man  would  easier  use  switch  use  use  main  yeah  like  method  okay  okay  oh  okay  mmhmm  affirmative  decode  scanner  one  instead  mmhmm  affirmative  choose  whatever  choose  right  go  leave  everything  mmhmm  affirmative  kind  like  organize  better  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  sometimes  mainly  used  organize  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  yeah  right  way  though  way  actually  spatial  code  packer  dude  give  know  okay  okay  loop  right  packet  cause  clicked  look  like  yeah  two  different  date  one  th  one  th  like  tomorrow  whole  thing  supposed  part  yeah  supposed  oh  printed  yeah  didnt  hand  yet  bag  okay  cause  packet  packet  thought  two  different  thing  cause  there  special  reason  packet  there  one  yeah  isnt  okay  eight  right  eight  okay  well  bring  okay  alright  second  one  easier  oh  okay  go  mmhmm  affirmative  really  get  okay  square  hope  dont  like  method  method  everything  solid  work  starting  dont  know  clip  wrap  around  neck  something  go  hell  thats  crazy  think  trick  question  know  oh  goodness  fuck  oh  goddammit  cant  afford  take  zero  could  damn  thats  terrible  think  argument  thank  god  switched  thats  crazy  man  didnt  like  first  one  somehow  giving  error  question  asking  enter  string  main  method  making  next  method  input  mmhmm  affirmative  okay  running  loop  next  method  oh  okay  neither  thats  crazy  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  aaron  dude  im  going  figure  later  yeah  got  help  im  going  hop  google  something  ill  see  man  bad  havent  even  im  going  hand  alright  catch  later  man  seven  thats  crazy  kind  vehicle  thats  crazy  damn

yeah just crosstalk  mmhmm affirmative crosstalk  dude i had no idea what im doing this is great  i think i know what its talking about crosstalk  its just super inefficient its to get the point across crosstalk  enter with a rectangle crosstalk  intx crosstalk  input dot next int  crosstalk  okay here  wait there crosstalk  rectangle crosstalk  anthony quick question crosstalk  i feel that quick question if this is say the method for rectangle for instance how do i call this value up here crosstalk  because this does the calculations and it calls the value crosstalk  oh so i need to make this crosstalk  it should just be public static  crosstalk  hold on should i have a  that or something along those lines i just want to figure out how to get  im very new to methods i just wanted to know how to get that there how that worked okay yes for this case it will be int crosstalk  assuming im not taking double assuming i dont take doubles which is for the sake of conversation yeah should i just delete the into here because its not necessary really crosstalk  i thought the method to get dimensions of each shape crosstalk  this bit instead of having a switch here instead of having this in this portion of the switch  those should be crosstalk  this is here so we dont need the int here actually yeah we dont nee the ints because theyre up here crosstalk  do i need to make a new scanner should i make a new scanner then for this do i need to have  okay we have this and now how do i get this method to return of value for this i basically want this to return whatever value i get here so how do i  is there a return command or do i just put the name would i just do like return area i would do area here do i need to do like rectangle and then parentheses over there or  it has to know  right now it doesnt know which method im talking about i dont know how to do that do you just type call did i spell it wrong maybe crosstalk  i dont think i am should i delete the parameter okay now this needs inaudible  now i need to crosstalk  in here and in there nope same kind of  i think we have to call this but i dont want to crosstalk  oh thats how you do it then if i do three and three  oh okay okay okay i gotcha that makes a lot more sense to me okay gotcha all right that makes sense okay thank you i understand anthony crosstalk  its still inefficient crosstalk  square  crosstalk  curiosity if i delete this will that cause problems crosstalk  do you understand how to do this  this is basically how it works methods are gonna kind of act as the stuff thats in your case basically what you do basically a word with two parentheses after it is a method all right basically what you do is  i have a switch here and its basically if its rectangle it displays that and then when it gets to this rectangle itll go to this method when it gets to this method  yeah its gonna read method and then its gonna run this portion of the code then this is basically youre gonna have to redeclare everything that i have so crosstalk  i have a new scanner here i basically asked them the width i declare my x i put in my y i get the area then you have to have something that the methods gonna return basically like whats the final value of this method i did return area when it goes back up here it runs this and its finally gonna return area which is gonna give me that crosstalk  its basically all of this up to here its cut and paste from the case state you just moved it over they want us to do it like this for the sake of learning it crosstalk  stuff like player movement and things like that its gonna get pretty inaudible  pretty fast the way methods work is its kind of like it doesnt have to read  as she described its like a calculator it only calls on different calculators when it needs them other than having all of them available at once for this case we use the switch to do the name this next one would be like try square crosstalk  stuff like that you can yeah when you program theres a billion different ways to do things theres no difference between them i just did it because it looks prettier crosstalk  i have nothing else to say on that crosstalk  yeah this is in the main and then this ends the main ends then i give a new method crosstalk  i go to here and i go to square and then i do intx crosstalk  im basically just gonna copy this because crosstalk  code crosstalk  while i do square  oh hold on that should be different that should just be  crosstalk  if i had the metamethod  for triangle  crosstalk  all right im getting this im getting this do you need any more explanations no youre good youre fine its doing that because you havent returned anything yet currently that has no value you have to write the rest of your code its basically like watch if i have triangle and i delete this crosstalk   your method has to return something otherwise it has no point in running crosstalk  okay crosstalk  as far as i know theres probably a way to do it around it but i dont know it crosstalk  the reason why you add methods is so  look at this this crosstalk  the  crosstalk  this is pokemon check this out crosstalk  this was my pokemon this is the pokemon yen  that i programmed one of the things i found really annoying was how cluttered it got i had this switch statement here i was like oh thats shit then  sorry crosstalk  got to remember that basically see how cluttered how it keeps going over and over and over and then you have all of this here and it gets mixed in and it keeps going over basically what youre doing is youre putting those calculations off to the side and it would basically just look like this  which is far easier to understand crosstalk  you use it mainly to just get rid of the clutter and put it somewhere else its like imagine instead of having all crosstalk  your stuff scattered all around your room you put it in a box and then you only grab the box when you need it yeah and then crosstalk  it goes to this rather than the pokemon crosstalk  that we did which is basically it ran a  statement crosstalk  thing here i could probably program this again actual code that does stuff will probably only be like twice as long as this case statement i would move everything to the bottom and then whenever i needed to edit it id edit it id basically just go to these statements and id just be like method for rectangle crosstalk  id have another be like method for choosing with pokemon to install man i thought methods were totally useless but now i kind of want to redo the other project i did crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  if you have a really complex program its gonna be incredibly disorganized now if i do circle and i do like four yeah  crosstalk  does that kind of help explain why you do them yeah as far as i know crosstalk  when you get to more advanced stuff and its like say youre doing player movement crosstalk  you might have hundreds of lines of code for just player movement you might have another hundreds of lines of code for just gravity on player when you would do your code and youd be like making a level or something all youd have to do is call player movement like a one word statement instead of having  things if you want to do the calculation more than once you can just call it twice rather than having to write the whole thing twice im liking it crosstalk  inquire crosstalk  scanner crosstalk  dude that was honestly so eye opening crosstalk  come on crosstalk  yes crosstalk  i didnt do a square today crosstalk  the second one is a case where youd absolutely not use a method but they want us to use a method so im using a method crosstalk  theres so  crosstalk  theres two  crosstalk  do we have a problem crosstalk  oh okay crosstalk  public static crosstalk  i have a better way of doing this super quick question so problem  was just random method that calculates heads or tails this works but is this the way that we were supposed to do it cause it basically just does the calculation here and then if its equal to zero  if the methods equal to zero it basically prints that and if its not it prints this yeah cause is either gonna return zero or one and basically if its zero its even and if its one its odd well thats why i was asking is this the way youre supposed  is it an acceptable way of doing this oh got it i thought that it always had to go back to the inaudible  cool oh  im about to go so  yes yeah i think hes still working though weve got two minutes okay so this is the code for activity  this is the code for activity  oh do you have domain of your method so wheres your other method go to one of your methods for like rectangles alright youve got rectangles so go back up rectangle  yeah its working whats the problem that is because  hold up inaudible  and you have all the crap in here is this inside or outside your interval okay its inside square  your returning area you might have to use dot equals in an if statement oh ive been done ive just been helping him out oh i forgot to do the exit form crap to do what the exit form oh my god i have to put my name they know i cant spell thats the interesting crosstalk  this is my official response whatd you learn about today whatd you not understand oh my god theres a page two no how do you feel about our teamwork today be honest solid solid it is oh wow thats almost two minutes ill never get back yeah i was about to say  because if statements  for case statements you can just take it but for if im pretty sure you need a dot equals just because java and if this was any other language it would just work if anything it would just correct it thats one of the better parts about c sharp c sharps like you made an error i just fixed it for you because youre going to college here how do i stop this hold on march th   inaudible  where you wanna put that dude mines broken no it doesnt clip it pulls back  i am not doing that tell you what ill put it through a button hole im gonna try something thats probably not going to work but well see what happens ah shit just gotta make this one inaudible  once what its always a trick question when has it ever not been a trick question this is a cruel class do you ever want to just take the zero and just go home its literally current mindset today its just like  dude it just isnt worth it when the class average gets  of the poll everywhere right like i couldve sworn it was a parameter i might go with local variable but i really dont think thats  its all i know how many methods are used in this program yeah can this class get over  raise your hand if you got a  today god no idea what im doing here inaudible  man i am not looking hot for this exam coming up i got mine working but with a little help from online the amount of freaking description i had to do for assignment two its like  lines of typing cause that was the pseudocode for it i hate when you see the solutions sometimes and its just so few lines of code and so simple and its like why does that work you read and you understand why it works but its like why is it that simple my first iteration of this was i had like six different variables because i didnt know what to do dude honestly for this exam im gonna copy and paste this program into my one page of notes cause its just like im not gonna remember how to do it this is crazy yeah inaudible  yeah ill catch you later dude vamos  yeah ill email this to you so you can take a look at it  we got to do we have to press something on there alright see ya i remember the steps inaudible  i remember you said inaudible  for part two and were not allowed to use inaudible  you want to use the weight eight here this is  i promise you these are correct here this is just kind of like shows the type of developers these people are i only get a inaudible  not many borderlands inaudible  this game or another seth  its its own game okay that part i dont agree with but moving on its right here so do i yeah its inaudible  piece of work hard to inaudible  so they take a very inaudible   to their inaudible  thats like their spoof trailer because thats like a song thats the like  thats a famous kind of song like in the jungle the mighty jungle so they just  they bought the rights for that inaudible  trailer yeah okay yeah cause we were wondering about that its  one two  so i think the first step for declaring inaudible  im pretty sure is just this cause its like you declared a range here which is a number and you just input the range there and then  i gotta look for the inaudible  ive got it here so  hold on weve got to do  index zero four i equals the one i is inaudible  not my list greater than  hold on this is  wait double max inaudible  i dont know if this is right but thats what they use thats what they use for finding the max inaudible  when i first played this game i had to have been like  man yeah im about to turn  im  but im about to turn  and it came out seven years ago thats a long ass time oh we do have the mic on eight wait im just going to copy this this is literally just saying how to display an array damn dude we have lab tomorrow i actually have to wake up early wouldnt you know of course inaudible  the values yet inaudible  so i was like yeah print out your array and its like zero zero zero zero zero zero zero inaudible  oh here we go there we go i was inaudible  random hold on thats a random  what inaudible  again oh yeah the  cause you gotta cast the  yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep that didnt work oh yeah cause you gotta do  hold on you gotta do this you gotta do  plus  cause its gonna generate a number between zero and  you also divide by  yeah it should have worked why doesnt that work i dont understand im gonna fight im gonna just come up and inaudible  just a quick question what part of this am i doing wrong cause this is currently not entering any values to the array cause its basically like oh run it or theyre like  and its all zero yeah i got you so dont need to  thank you i appreciate it i inaudible  once again for the second time today yeah what you had to do is you had to separate in inaudible  next value in array by showing inaudible  theyre showing its value and index of that value i just want to  wow that works let me try it again wow i didnt expect that to work but it did you can copy them this is just a model they use to do it is they do this basically if the array is great than  so its basically like that entry is greater than the maximum entry than the max now equals that entry and the index is equal to whatever were on so its basically so this is so the max is currently three and this is four four is greater than three so its gonna set max equal to this which is four and then theyre gonna set the index equal to i so say this is the eleventh term the index is now eleven and then it runs again and its like  so this is seven now its gonna do  the max is now equal to seven and the index is equal to  seven instead its like  yeah and so this is three then it will just increment i and then go again cause its not im gonna guess how to do this one but i think im gonna get it right let me test this            x  x              divided by  is  so it is working find the elements that have higher values than the average value and copy them into a new array named high values all right so thats just another formula this is hard yeah oh it crashed nope yeah im gonna ask for guidance so i  in theory i thought this would work so i basically  is it possible to generate an array without a fix lane okay so i just did zero for instance and then basically what this loop does is its gonna iterate through the original array and its basically  if its greater than the average i add this value which is currently at zero equal that value and then x increases does that like  is this illegal like it  okay lets try this because its still loading so how do i  cause plus equals didnt work there either is  how do you add terms to an array and not  cause all im trying to do here is basically just be like mmhmm affirmative yeah this is  this is the first array so this is the one that the person sets and its basically saying if its greater than its own average down here i was gonna have this second array which is a new one currently theres nothing in it basically this entry which is currently at zero would be equal to the value of that index of that arrays index and then it increases to the next index so that when this runs again it says greater then inaudible  the array crosstalk  no theyre gonna be different lengths okay so how do i just like  what would keep tacking  cause all im trying to do is keep tacking on terms to array two you put cause its basically  like the assignment is you take all the  you take all of the values that are higher than the average in one array and you stick em in another array its basically you find all the events that have higher value than the average and you copy them into a new one mmhmm affirmative okay okay so then this segment will  cause you get what im trying to do right feeble at best so youre saying that i should do for  im just like im worrying here i will inaudible  yeah hold on inaudible  and then in this one well do  yeah this should just work yes inaudible  cause i was like im like i know this logic is good im kind of like theres obviously some questions i dont know yeah that makes sense i understand they have boundaries i just didnt know how to get around those boundaries uhhuh affirmative okay inaudible  cause its like i took c in high school one and two oh so long ago and i dont remember a lot of the nuances yes that command i remember there you go thats where inaudible  huh all right this should work all right im on the last step okay that works oh are you currently stuck on any in particular set  average like displaying the average or making a new array with the average okay so he actually showed something really smart cause my logic was right i just was missing pieces then what you do is you make a counter  and basically what you have is you do another loop and it basically gets greater than the average above the counter line cause arrays have to be a fixed length you cant add to them and subtract from them if you say theyre this length they are that length so what you do is you make a counter the counter goes up at  so this loop calculate the array so this one here this loop every time the index is gonna be higher than the average the counters gonna go up then all you have to do is just make your new array the length of that counter and then what you have here is this loops basically  if the array is greater than the average the array twos index of currently is zero is gonna equal whatever that arrays index is and then yeah so this is like  lets separate this into yeah you are cause d its telling you to move the values into a new array oh the average what i did was i basically summed all the terms and then divided by the length thats what i did so i summed all the terms inside the loop and then outside the loop i divided by the length just wanna make sure this works real quick mmhmm affirmative im currently organizing it so it isnt ugly like what im doing what i find really helpful is im having a coat b coat c coat d that way its just  its just a little easier yeah so like if i have a problem i can just go there f creating another array the same type and size of the source array all right and  oh shit dude all right ill email you this this is like its a little weird huh yeah sure feel free oh were they similar eight so i already talked to nazerine  about this its basically this low value to begin with should be four not three but no matter that we pick three because the other ones are not choice this ones ready to go equals two yada yada yada  yeah yeah yeah when you get down here is the problem because those are like obviously its a typo not the end of the world this ones right but when you get here rq were looking for is six which is still behind  because right now our unit is  so six is behind it so normally youd pick is less than mid and that says now we check the upper half which you wouldnt do youd check the lower half and then if you were to pick anything else theres no option to continue off of it so these two things are both wrong because i imagine the array was different than when they wrote the question well i found this out afterwards the rest of it is kind of manageable theyre pretty much completely wrong because its like basically you get a unit as  and were looking for six so our key is less than  and this says now check the other remaining half and then  which is wrong it should be the lower remaining half and then you cant even add another option to back that up i doubt any of this was can we just like yeah thats what i said can we just eradicate this step you wouldnt have finished because youd have to go through another duration of finding inaudible  because right now you have them in as  and thats still greater than the key so itd want another time and so the new mid which would end up being six crosstalk   so its like both seven and eight dont work this is basically like i just copied this over this mystery method is this which i copied from an earlier question which was provided earlier what i imagine is when this question was written you had a different array asking for different things oh see well this is mystery method too this is the binary one this is the linear one i did this so that i could keep it one crosstalk  yeah well thats actually it i renamed it but its basically just redundant i think when this question was written it had a different array associated with it i mean if we could just not count these questions i mean its kind of problem solved key is six this is question  yeah theyre already when theyre like what to pick afterwards thank you yes this is for question  thank you theyre going to invalidate question  yeah theyre going to double check one more time but im pretty sure they had a different array when they wrote it so anyway its going to be stranded which surface is more efficient for finding inaudible  binary question  are you guys working through question  skip that for now because im pretty sure its wrong theres supposed to be a different regulate so shes checking over it right now because im pretty sure theres an error  page  just casually go there its the one on it i think just this source just got so many problems with it this is dumb  point  almost starting here we are of course its definitely on page  of course it is because why wouldnt it not be on that page oh bubble inaudible  yeah this is like the worst type of stern yeah its basically like what this is doing is two is less than nine so it ignores it five plus the nine so ignores it four is less than nine so it ignores it eight is less than nine so it ignores it it basically just keeps swapping it to just make sure that  its pretty dumb because it has to go through like a billion iterations in order to work but its a way of sorting where  its just worse quite frankly because when you crosstalk  well its probably some another guy trying to get a fricking phd but its basically like linear serving you only have to pass through it once actually never mind the way this is  this is actually different i didnt think about it this is a sorting method not a searching method so this is how it sorts numbers theres better options well leave it at that because this has to go through dozens of iterations sometimes i should have copied this just straight from there some ecstatic word mystery method in for open open open dude they even screwed up the starting method good on them what a bunch of capable individuals open open one one two three two one yep exactly as i said dude they screwed up twice they messed up brackets huh it works can you check over my logic then because i honestly dont see where they  that just means i dont understand something so you get this is length minus one so seven plus eight is zero divided by two is  which goes to three so zero one two three so mid is  six is smaller so go on to the next thing our new low variable is equal to the mid plus one which is three plus one which is four so mid is now equal to four even though we have to take oh i got you i got you okay my new high variable i missed that one code man i missed it yeah that one right there my variable is two that makes sense that makes a lot of sense so now its two divided by two which is one mid now equals six and so our mid is equal a key switch our mid which is once all right yep that makes sense that makes sense man im dumb sometimes this is a bubble this is a bubble story right   oh were doing this by hand all right thats inaudible  okay oh well swap those youre good how do you get the two over there i thought that wasnt possible i thought that with first iteration it wasnt possible all right so five and three swap so five and three swaps to get three five and you get two five i need a piece of paper for this all right so you have  i still dont think this is right five three two eighths nine six so five and three swaps this is three five five swaps so three is less than five i have no idea what these guys are smoking man one two three well im missing a bracket if you dont mind me asking so this is missing a bracket and i dont know where to put it like it has three opening brackets and two closing brackets well if its like a loop you dont want to be looping okay okay okay i just wanted to check before i started the calculation oh i dont even know what i started to screw up there oh because it skipped down three five oh thats too funny all right five three two eight this will go to three five two two five eight eight eight three two five eight why not shh all right so three five three five and  plus three and five i dont even know one and one five and three go to four and five and to five and three you have three five two eighths you have to swap three to five eight and you go three  so its you just got swapped so its three two  im not going to finish man theres no way im finishing this one oh lets do nine nine inaudible  and i do add nine oh i still dont know what kind of shape this is going to do well what kind of method is this supposed to be for inaudible  it could be a selection sort as well two that i dont know what type of surface is im piggybacking off of them watch me selections wait am i not doing it im pretty sure we did a selections for it two and five swap oh yeah i get this i get this i get this whats value three five whats the next list value five five and nine so stay six point eight two three five six eight five six seven nine eight eight five six seven nine eight two three five six seven eight nine three five six seven all right so for this one the way it works it picks the lowest number and swaps it so it goes to the first index and swaps it with the lowest number in the eighth then next lowest number so initially its five so the first index is five it then swaps it with the lowest number in the array which is two so two and five swap places then you go to the next one then goes the second one it takes three it then compares it to the second lowest number in the array three is the second lowest number so it stays the same you go to the next one it goes to the third index where it takes the third lowest number in this case is five that ends up being the same so it stays the same you go to the next one however eight any hot tips on how to iterate through d array any hot tips on how iterate through a d array listed im just going to do that good enough dude this hurts this one all right i have no idea how to loop through this fishing hole  are we in the same textbook good old copy and paste i mean it works right it works it works mine is not so  ready heres the function to pull it see if it works holy shit it works haves mrs richcroft yes its working it works its ridiculous well thats because this is missing a digit done going home pretty much ill figure out what that does later put this  is it pulling on yours stick that end in your pocket we can have this work see what happens solved the issue though all right so weve  this should just do between zero and nine right do you have  there you go this is not going to work i know this for a fact its just not average divided by  no way this works im only  oh im at the averaging part its killing me  i think i can figure it out but ill come yelling if i need it appreciate it i have no idea what im doing i just copied it from the book and changed their metrics value to mid array it was all i did three plus three plus two is eight divided by two is four whyd it add up in only one column though do you see anything wrong with this like im running it theres no errors or anything because theres no values in it its got nothing to theres no  well then you havent put any values in it yet  it started to working time to inaudible  and see if anything works i broke it yeah im going to kill the owner crosstalk  at the same time i was getting tutoring and i crosstalk  with my buddies last night until  am and it was in south hall so by the time i got back here it was  am so i woke up at like  suppose youre be up normal at  and crosstalk  it was like crosstalk  i mean theyre soft but that would be it were doing chapter eight and i realized that crosstalk  and i got crosstalk  and i realized for a crosstalk  theres also a big overlap with a crosstalk  yeah yeah i just cant process how this should be done actually lets just do this i just realized i havent is there really inaudible  what else do they want to find an export crosstalk  all right ive got one of them working i have no idea how to make this work as a function though so crosstalk  does track hatch exist in java does track hatch exist in java im just really struggling on how to make a function like this calculates for only the first column which you average only the first column im struggling to make inaudible  where its going to do it for every column depending on how many columns there are because like because you need  because its like if you have three columns you need to have three averages like you could also have five columns in which case you need five averages and i dont know how to make it so its like like how many like make more averages if i need to like because what i yeah the width and then this ones hard its basically like youre going to generate youre going to generate a random number of columns and rows youre going to fill them with random values and then you need to display the average of each of the columns of each column separately so its like so when you run it is like  so you have like this im just struggling on how you would input the values because you would do  come on lets try this so in it is lets just do that for now so average lets just try something here so this is going to take the average  so the first one its going to do  look because it wouldnt work because it would do it would skip it it would like spread it out so you have to do youd have to do  this is why ive been struggling because im like i cant this is fucked because it has inaudible  since you are only going to find it nine you can just do the same thing nine times and then just do a tricatch and then you wouldnt have to worry about it but thats really inefficient like so its like so if you have average so the initial turn its going to be n array its going to be the first turn in the arrays its going to be first second and third fourth fifth this is going to be no i think i know how to simplify it yeah thats something that im like i dont know how to convert that yeah i dont know how to yeah so lets do n k plus zero yeah the average of k yeah youre right oh so what how would you do this so hold on this is the value that has to change k has to change and ks going to be here so its made array of i k so this would basically set i almost dont want to increase k but i know you have to because you cant break the loop otherwise for now im just going to comment to the side because i just kind of need this for like this is what were trying to get to oh hold on hold on hold on this is going to do  this is rows this is columns hold on because this shouldnt have any coding  because this shouldnt have any coding this is dictating how many times this loops so what do we want this to be calculating in its loop because this is going to calculating i think it should calculate the average per  oh you know what you could do you could do because this is going to have to be hmm these are not crosstalk  oh abg abg plus one yeah  same one thats a thing whats the crosstalk  that equals abg inaudible  im like so turned around right now and then  so just let me do  because you have to print lets just for seeing what it is at least like that whats the all right whats this lets see what this gets us thats in the print thats an error in the print thats not an error because ive gotten this before its an error in the print its got to be print this  im not doing it with that one thats for sure zero five one youd get youd get six divided by three is two so that ones right this is going to be  divided by three which is close to  seven  yeah its just getting it right  divided by four is closest to  so four so it seems to be working im going to spend the next  minutes storming out of here im like how the hell does that work yeah equal to  oh well im just commenting crosstalk  yeah because this adds up the column because this is taking  this is going to do an index zero  so index zero is equal to  so originally this is going to be a zero and then zero and thats going to be zero one zero two zero three zero four so it is adding the entries of a column yeah so this is adds up the column stores it in abg array this average by the mid turns crosstalk  i just im like i dont crosstalk  this  thank you thank you so much frick an a im noticing a pattern here sweet holy fuck this was a really hard one there was i want to say like  i worked with the other ta and there was one nested formula that we basically used four times for everything single thing that we learned mines done completely yes row column neo it does it from zero to nine because its  since n equals to nine yeah but were trying to generate from zero to nine this generates this takes zero to nine im pretty sure if its one to nine ill just add one to it its not horrible it might be yeah its one to nine so ill just do nine and then ill just add tack on a plus one to the end yeah right so what does inaudible  do how do you inaudible  how do you discard displaying the array like outright like to display a d array right here because how did you display the array because this is what i used because its kind of sort of complicated to display it can you run it so i can see what you mean so its all zeroes are you filling it correctly mmhmm affirmative it wont fill it with a number hold on can you put that back other way na what is this na im just testing something because im pretty sure you cant have that space otherwise it doesnt change it all right never mind i never use the  did you import the works did you import the random method random r equals new method new random you got to put an s  mmhmm affirmative so you got to do this whole thing in parenthesis and then run it and pull it i mean you got to cut it off before that turn oh this was a really hard one i mean like figure out was it hard i thought it was really hard i wouldnt have gotten it without the other tas help mmhmm affirmative mmhmm affirmative on a side note did you get an email from professor talking about my absence next week i just want to check because ive been trying to get him to send a written letter so theres proof i dont think he sent them yet but ive been reminding him because i need his official signature so i have official paperwork okay it is julio bahaman  yeah because so far none of my teachers have got anything and like i need this as soon as possible or its going to cause problems and so also anyway i can make up the pole everywhere im going to not  im going to be not there for so do i get so does mean automatic zeroes or like just invalidate them could we just invalidate them because the whole point is im just trying to get this as an excused absence  im kind of like a little borderline though so im worried thats good so theres a hand written assignment or a paper i could write or anything all right well when you get an email with my  well talk about this again i think ill be seeing her how many emails do you have honestly this is not even my own program this was the back half is inaudible  subject n  this one was  this one hurt my head dude oh its easy and then you try to figure out how to do it and youre like holy crap why is this  what is this bologna exits one oh man i almost forgot inaudible  dorm  i dont know im like that describes today i inaudible  perfect i dont understand go positive or ill go neutral it doesnt cost much question thank you helps a lot youre kidding right im about to hit up the library dude im going to try not to because i need to get to bed inaudible  at  am last night things got out of hand im going to take these to him so i was wrongly mistaken eight doing it so i can just spread it out onto the floor cause im like sick and tired of balancing act every single part of this  i didnt do it right  perfect whats the second part of this thing create a method and an average this method gets a two dimensional arrays includes calculates the average alright  so notice with d arrays you literally just use this exact same formula every single time for doing anything with dimensional arrays all right this is getting deleted yeah i can see why they want us to put it in a method cause so far my main method code consists of just this one line cause its literally just gonna be i think this works if i do two by two one two three four yeah it works no it works i just find it funny the main methods align  so in the first method youre asking for the size of the array and to fill the array in the second method youre taking the average of it what i did is this asks the user how many rows youd like how many columns then it fills it by saying how many would you like then this one takes the average but the thing it requires a d array which was made in this so what i did is i just put that method in the other method so that this is gonna return a d array and then this uses a d array so it just works and i looked at the wrong program i let this thing friggin hello world program class activities new class activity activity for one mod for javautil public static void main string parse    shit this should still work have like one column one averages one  yeah i basically did once youre in the for loop i had the array and then the index would be the first for loop and the second index would be the second for loop so it would be row column and then you do  inputnext activity  the second programs pretty much the same thing i mean its different  how do you do ascii code again im gonna get real for  is equal to int hang on mathrandom   a turns to  right so theres  letters so  x     it might actually work user defined styles will close the array with random characters   create a search method which asks users to search for a character and returns the index all right public static int search char array scan  for char  how do you take a spin and put input thats what i have oh cause i have a zero in here good work  character  charactertouppercase uh yeah check   if character    ive never seen gray before  ive forgotten how to take a char as input so inputnextchar all right i was missing the next so im gonna change this sign for the average i would only use the same for loop except i did average  whatever that index is and then i add a counter when withits i get the end i get average divided by the counter  so i use the same for loop yeah in a separate method of course  arrays a  i  no what oh cause im dumb enter is return arrays return     arrays theres probably better ways of doing this but oh well alright so if we do search arrays int array  new int x  triple array  if array  does he realize our microphones are on  if is   row array is  i mean if this works on the first try ill be pretty impressed id like to have  rows for this columns  columns it didnt work  because i fucked up thats why actually  rows  columns enter a character to search for a wow it actually worked on the first try    ish  i dont even know what i just did  alright it works  i just gotta comment it  hey it works finally  total   i just finished anything youre stuck on well i think for starters so your bread and butter the d arrays over here  your bread and butter is this loop format you have just two nested loops where its basically this is how youre gonna iterate through your d array this is gonna keep your of your columns thats gonna keep track of your rows collator like do this later i changed this like three times until i realized it had to be just this  well cause what you can do is in a method you can still do put a scanner in there you take input so what i did is i have this ignore this for now i made a method its supposed to generate an array a d array so this is what its gonna return and this is what is required for it to run if it doesnt require anything then you just put it blank no it doesnt have any parameters at the moment because this is basically like if you just type in if i typed in just arrays that it would run it doesnt need any parameters so this first asks for your amount of rows then amount of columns this is gonna declare a d array with the amount of rows and columns  ignore it dont go back up here for now so this is youve input here youve got input here youve got a rows value and columns value this is gonna declare a d array with that rows value and that columns value so thats how big it is this loop is the bread and butter this iterates through your rows this one iterates through your columns this is how you iterate through a d array what your gonna do is you can interchange this like literally every method you do with the d array is just gonna have this same base and then something different in here so in this case their supposed to enter in their own values im basically taking  thats the size of the array  thats like do you want a  or a  this is would you want an index  then when it goes again it will do you want to index  this will populate the array this is rows thats columns basically gonna go row  and then its gonna do column     whatever once that finishes because thats basically taking the row length once that finishes it goes back up to here this goes up to  then it goes up to row  then  whatever  so then after that once this is all done i return the array because its given me an array at this point all you have is a d array with values that the user generated well for now im just doing return to the array so the next we have to do is take an average so what you do is you have to figure out before you do a method is what are you gonna need to do that method and what are you trying to get out of this method so for an average youre trying to get a number in order to take that average i need a d array so what i did is you take the parameter as the d array so this is just  this is just an array its saying that the only thing that you need to make this method work is you need a d array to pull from so this is basically saying when you refer to it is gonna be looking for a d array this is basically just an average encounter this is the same bread and butter loop which is the same thing as that instead of having this in the middle i basically had average whatevers at that spot so whatevers at index  and then  then  that keeps adding it to the average every time it loops the counter goes up because thats gonna be the number of turns ill get to that for a second so then its just gonna return the average divided by the counter now the big thing is right now your program doesnt do anything because the main methods not doing it so what you needed to do is you know that you first need to call this method because this is how youre gonna get your d array so you schlop that on there which is arrays you then realize thats the best one youre gonna need d array to pull from so this method is a gonna return a d array so you can just put what you need to do is put this method in the parameters for the other method so this is gonna run so this is like at the moment you have just this yeah so this will run that one returns the d array so this value is now d array this requires a d array as the parameter which this now will hold the value of a d array so this will now run when this runs its gonna return an average lets say  so this whole method now just becomes the value these combined methods just become the value  this just prints the averages   the problem with methods is you have to plan ahead you have to know what you need to make the method and what you need to return it because what i could also do the reason we have to keep it like that i could just make another method here but it does a different d array then over here that means i can run this method succussfully with either of the new d arrays it would give the average value if you were gonna do    if you were to do this for instance you just gotta give it a size  yeah so if you did this and you were to do average if you were to do    and you were just to do test array this works because this is a d array this requires a d array to run when this method results its gonna result in a d array so basically this will always print  because that hasnt populated but if you were to run you say how many rows  enter values youd be like  so the average is  and this one the average is  that way you can have one method which just calculates a specific thing then you can just  so i can enter any d array i wanted into this average thing and it will always run thats how methods are useful  so it takes the clump out of the main code and it allows a reusable calculation so if you have to do something more than once you can just call the method and it will do it you got it i will email you both of these but i gotta head on out but i hope that helped the codes all commented as well in programming theres always a billion ways to do everything so always find a way that works for you  alright i will catch you later  you got any questions hit me up pretty much you may have noticed every time i had to do something with a d array i did that doublenested for loop thing which basically iterate thats just how you iterate it if you had a similar youd do the exact same thing except at only one point thats just how you iterate it then you can do everything else from there  im gonna call it this is signing off,yeah  mmhmm  affirmative  dude  idea  im  great  think  know  talking  super  inefficient  get  point  across  enter  rectangle  intx  input  dot  next  int

 th   max inaudible   that basically just goes through and if no numbers bigger than it then it doesnt do anything  i get it then when you initiate you said the one that youre looking for is biggest to zero right and then you just assign it to whatever index its at that basically just goes through and if no numbers bigger than it then it doesnt do anything i get it then when you initiate you said the one that youre looking for is biggest to zero right and then you just assign it to whatever index its at all right okay so this you do while the number of the index is greater than that you assign the number of that index to that and then that index im trying to find the largest number in it okay and then this will go through all the indexes but nothing will get assigned because of that right index is just like the index that the largest number is located at right yeah oh how do you make it display like the number that its at okay yeah so what would i assign for that though location oh gotcha yeah and you basically do that same thing for the other one they wanted to make into an array but you just keep doing it right all right got the first two parts down calculate the hourly r why does it have to have the same size if youre just why does it have to have the same size you need the size before you make okay i dont see anything about vectors in the book tanner are you done im not surprised youve been using arrays like this whole time laughs uh is that the right logic for that if source that index is greater than average than high numbers that index is that an index yeah they just which one yeah oh okay so what would i put so youre saying that should iterate in here and that should iterate on its own so that that goes through and then this one only iterates under that condition okay yeah i gotcha so like i got the all right so i got that set of zero out there yeah i got you that makese sense what else did we need to do we dont even print how do you shuffle them do another for loop what happened so to shuffle em you literally just make the same for loop again all right theres another way to shuffle em i read in the book but whatever create another array of the same type and assign the yeah thats what i was gonna do just do it can i see it what did you have wrong about it oh you didnt initialize the first one and ohh okay word yeah these are pretty easy what did you okay so you didnt even put in a size in there yet and then you just wait no that wouldnt be right no it has to be the same size as the other one right yeah yeah yeah start equals and then what did you do a while loop while start is less than array size oh yeah cause its supposed to go its supposed to go from the half of that one to that one but its it didnt say to print any other arrays though right okay so this is what you did cause that starts it at that and then that starts it at zero okay but were not supposed to output any of the information like its just supposed to oh shit what nah  wait no line  nah its gotta be this one what isnt it supposed to be array size divided by two though what does yours look like cause thats weird all my other stuff worked wait no yours is different count is less than size divided by two so im supposed to do that same equation for that because you dont want the count to go further than how many numbers youre trying to copy right okay thats probably it that makes sense no worries yeah it works yeah yeah i dont know why were not supposed to output any of that but all right well no ill see you tomorrow i said see you next week but i was like no we have a lesson i dont know if its like weird to inaudible  crosstalk  oh yeah okay it works crosstalk  i figured theres a reason you guys crosstalk  oh were done with our recorder thing too  say what well i was printing a reference thats why because i asked chris  or i asked david crosstalk  what did you have to do mine says it has an error  oh no is it this but that wouldnt make sense well its one to nine right that still wouldnt make sense i dont know whats going on crosstalk  out of bounds two no it does the same thing i dont understand theyre just literally exactly the same that makes no sense say what where inaudible  hey david im getting an error saying that its out of bounds but i cant really figure out why yeah oh so thats  thats counting  yeah i got you no so there should still be the both brackets too right i mean  lets see why that one its not the first time my computers done some weird shit though honestly oh wow jesus it looks so similar to inaudible  yeah all right i got to redo that that should inaudible  is it still  did you  these were swapped though arent they are they not oh yeah to find the averages i mean mmhmm affirmative all right so that flips it around basically right and then  and then you do average i plus  what is it you do average i plus  yeah oh you do both of them how do you print it how do you print it yeah do you have to  you have to share the average of it right these are kind of confusing me honestly yeah i dont know whats wrong with adding the averages up inaudible  the error was this one though theyre supposed to be swapped thats where it said the error came from so i must have done something wrong with that its out of bounds again what the hell oh oh yeah okay yeah because those are in the crosstalk  yeah wouldnt the average be  you have to divide to get that though right what the  yeah its still saying i got an out of bounds exception dude what the hell i got to read the chapter in the book about this because i dont  oh so you do average i divided by dimension one or dimension two theyre  why is it printing so many of them its the first one that looks right and then you got to find the max right how do you  you have to find the max in a different loop wait wouldnt this have to be  if youre going to find the greatest average wouldnt you just have to put an inaudible  statement in here is that what you did whats it for though oh yeah i got you for each average  th of  wait what what are you talking about we probably get no extra credit for that  okay crosstalk  so that would be it for filling the matrix up right oh and it has to return it right i dont remember dude thats my only thing that i hate about working on my laptop only is that ill read something and immediately forget what it said and i have to click back and forth so many times but when im at home i have my laptop and my desktop so i can not do that  you finished the whole thing already the second part of the first thing were supposed to do this isnt that difficult though  there has to be a simpler method though for average how do you use the method to define it hmm so i should do this part and then pass that in basically  yeah so its going to need the size in the main method or else im going to yeah i noticed that you did that and i thought i might be able to just do it for the other way but its not going to happen im sure theres a way to do it but its probably not anything im going to want to find out how to do so yeah forget about it  hold on but here we go now i have to change all my variable names  im just going to i already moved everything its okay i know what im doing so it doesnt matter if you finish way before i do thats no big deal  yeah  is there a way to make it so i dont have to declare my scanner in every method if i do it outside the main method like here you can do it  you can do that okay then what do you do to search for it would you do like if x contains the character and then you would do like you would return the index letter or something inaudible  i guess you only need to return an n value for the average one right okay yeah just trying to be careful you know were doing all this freaking whatever  so this is just the same thing but with a four over the anchor then right yeah yeah so these are easy to make really  you got to pass in the the real and con  values right for the average one too they say youre not supposed to use the same variable names but im not going to use different ones if im doing the same exact thing  oh yeah because theyre separate so you can just yeah  okay wait a second so for the average you would do average divided by the two array dimensions added together right like the each dimension and then thats what you would divide it by like if its two and two youd do two plus two or whatever ill just try it just see if it works  yeah thats why i was looking out there  kind of  lets see oh it doesnt even need to pa did you print the value of the average in your method or did you return it okay  yeah probably not crosstalk   oh i see why you did a double though  because for finding an average it gets weird  is that part easy oh so youre supposed to have the method that creates it and then the second method that searches it okay  what happened oh what are the numbers for the random number generator for the right screen values  to i think thats what it was yeah  thanks all right so you have to return this array from that so i got to declare an array ugh crosstalk   what wait a minute can i see oh its right there oh you have to do care  what does that work im assuming it does because yours is up still your cast is characters and it works okay yeah it does wow  should probably what oh just to make sure it works i hate when it does that  it autofills it in with fucking carat  or i mean has next  instead of next  ooh ooh what happened  really so what are you doing for the search method oh i dont need to do that i can just use the fucking things i got okay wait what okay yeah yeah  should i initialize these before i measure like in value one  yeah got you  all right and then what do you do inaudible  first and second  wait no yeah yeah  yeah because this is whats bringing back the yeah i got you yeah all right so then you would do then you just put these two values in the array after its done right okay  oh wait but this has to be the same name as my array right what did i name this fucking thing jesus equals i and index of search one equals j  what is this  yeah then you return it wait what do i need to put my thing here why is that is that it what oh  all right so how di you make it say how did you make it say if it wasnt in it basically if it equals negative one you do it saving outside yeah  oh the  class oh you guys are taking a different one than i am  im in   all right i think im done  yeah ,th  max  basically  go  number  bigger  doesnt  anything  get  initiate  said  one  youre  looking  biggest  zero  right  assign  whatever  index  basically  go  number  bigger  doesnt  anything  get  initiate  said  one  youre  looking  biggest  zero  right  assign  whatever  index  right  okay  number  index  greater  assign  number  index  index  im  trying  find  largest  number  okay  go  index  nothing  get  assigned  right  index  like  index  largest  number  located  right  yeah  oh  make  display  like  number  okay  yeah  would  assign  though  location  oh  gotcha  yeah  basically  thing  one  wanted  make  array  keep  right  right  got  first  two  part  calculate  hourly  r  size  youre  size  need  size  make  okay  dont  see  anything  vector  book  tanner  done  im  surprised  youve  using  array  like  whole  time  laugh  uh  right  logic  source  index  greater  average  high  number  index  index  yeah  one  yeah  oh  okay  would  put  youre  saying  iterate  iterate  go  one  iterates  condition  okay  yeah  gotcha  like  got  right  got  set  zero  yeah  got  makese  sense  else  need  dont  even  print  shuffle  another  loop  happened  shuffle  em  literally  make  loop  right  there  another  way  shuffle  em  read  book  whatever  create  another  array  type  assign  yeah  thats  gon  na  see  wrong  oh  didnt  initialize  first  one  ohh  okay  word  yeah  pretty  easy  okay  didnt  even  put  size  yet  wait  wouldnt  right  size  one  right  yeah  yeah  yeah  start  equal  loop  start  le  array  size  oh  yeah  cause  supposed  go  supposed  go  half  one  one  didnt  say  print  array  though  right  okay  cause  start  start  zero  okay  supposed  output  information  like  supposed  oh  shit  nah  wait  line  nah  got  ta  one  isnt  supposed  array  size  divided  two  though  look  like  cause  thats  weird  stuff  worked  wait  different  count  le  size  divided  two  im  supposed  equation  dont  want  count  go  many  number  youre  trying  copy  right  okay  thats  probably  make  sense  worry  yeah  work  yeah  yeah  dont  know  supposed  output  right  well  ill  see  tomorrow  said  see  next  week  like  lesson  dont  know  like  weird  oh  yeah  okay  work  figured  there  reason  guy  oh  done  recorder  thing  say  well  printing  reference  thats  asked  chris  asked  david  mine  say  error  oh  wouldnt  make  sense  well  one  nine  right  still  wouldnt  make  sense  dont  know  whats  going  bound  two  thing  dont  understand  theyre  literally  exactly  make  sense  say  hey  david  im  getting  error  saying  bound  cant  really  figure  yeah  oh  thats  thats  counting  yeah  got  still  bracket  right  mean  let  see  one  first  time  computer  done  weird  shit  though  honestly  oh  wow  jesus  look  similar  yeah  right  got  redo  still  swapped  though  arent  oh  yeah  find  average  mean  mmhmm  affirmative  right  flip  around  basically  right  average  plus  average  plus  yeah  oh  print  print  yeah  share  average  right  kind  confusing  honestly  yeah  dont  know  whats  wrong  adding  average  error  one  though  theyre  supposed  swapped  thats  said  error  came  must  done  something  wrong  bound  hell  oh  oh  yeah  okay  yeah  yeah  wouldnt  average  divide  get  though  right  yeah  still  saying  got  bound  exception  dude  hell  got  read  chapter  book  dont  oh  average  divided  dimension  one  dimension  two  theyre  printing  many  first  one  look  right  got  find  max  right  find  max  different  loop  wait  wouldnt  youre  going  find  greatest  average  wouldnt  put  statement  whats  though  oh  yeah  got  average  th  wait  talking  probably  get  extra  credit  okay  would  filling  matrix  right  oh  return  right  dont  remember  dude  thats  thing  hate  working  laptop  ill  read  something  immediately  forget  said  click  back  forth  many  time  im  home  laptop  desktop  finished  whole  thing  already  second  part  first  thing  supposed  isnt  difficult  though  simpler  method  though  average  use  method  define  hmm  part  pas  basically  yeah  going  need  size  main  method  else  im  going  yeah  noticed  thought  might  able  way  going  happen  im  sure  there  way  probably  anything  im  going  want  find  yeah  forget  hold  go  change  variable  name  im  going  already  moved  everything  okay  know  im  doesnt  matter  finish  way  thats  big  deal  yeah  way  make  dont  declare  scanner  every  method  outside  main  method  like  okay  search  would  like  x  contains  character  would  like  would  return  index  letter  something  guess  need  return  n  value  average  one  right  okay  yeah  trying  careful  know  freaking  whatever  thing  four  anchor  right  yeah  yeah  easy  make  really  got  pas  real  con  value  right  average  one  say  youre  supposed  use  variable  name  im  going  use  different  one  im  exact  thing  oh  yeah  theyre  separate  yeah  okay  wait  second  average  would  average  divided  two  array  dimension  added  together  right  like  dimension  thats  would  divide  like  two  two  youd  two  plus  two  whatever  ill  try  see  work  yeah  thats  looking  kind  let  see  oh  doesnt  even  need  pa  print  value  average  method  return  okay  yeah  probably  oh  see  double  though  finding  average  get  weird  part  easy  oh  youre  supposed  method  creates  second  method  search  okay  happened  oh  number  random  number  generator  right  screen  value  think  thats  yeah  thanks  right  return  array  got  declare  array  ugh  wait  minute  see  oh  right  oh  care  work  im  assuming  still  cast  character  work  okay  yeah  wow  probably  oh  make  sure  work  hate  autofills  fucking  carat  mean  next  instead  next  ooh  ooh  happened  really  search  method  oh  dont  need  use  fucking  thing  got  okay  wait  okay  yeah  yeah  initialize  measure  like  value  one  yeah  got  right  first  second  wait  yeah  yeah  yeah  whats  bringing  back  yeah  got  yeah  right  would  put  two  value  array  done  right  okay  oh  wait  name  array  right  name  fucking  thing  jesus  equal  index  search  one  equal  j  yeah  return  wait  need  put  thing  oh  right  di  make  say  make  say  wasnt  basically  equal  negative  one  saving  outside  yeah  oh  class  oh  guy  taking  different  one  im  right  think  im  done  yeah,0.13195308123249297,1
 all right on the average what did they average  all right i think i understand location if inaudible  is greater than inaudible   yep four six yeah whoops inaudible  wait are you sorting or yeah yeah i see that wait why are you no index equals mmhmm affirmative but thats not the index its just like panel whatever you cant use the index you need another variable so i use count off of the count and then i use the index its the thing youre iterating so index plus plus youll just be uh count equals index or whatever youre viewing for the yeah uh wait wait shuffle all elements of the short array and then target i dont know what those last ones are supposed to do hm you need at least well you need at least that many elements to guarantee that well technically you need that many elements to guarantee that you have enough space in your array since you dont whether its beforehand they imply you better use your vector here if there are vectors in java but since array you cant change yeah so its probably not vectors and uh both sides over two and then it targets something okay i think im done uhhuh affirmative yeah yeah why yeah yeah you need a separate variable for high number the j im assuming that it wants it in like consecutive not like at a certain index uh yeah you just yeah um zero four average is three okay so thats so theres size four so size three last two thats odd that should a low  its not doing what i want it to do oh thats why thats why yeah that is not right oh size the i dont know what im getting wrong here though crosstalk  oh i didnt thats what i did did it all right yeah i just didnt reset the value yeah its annoying though no no i did n target equals i just write use the same variable you had tied to it size no use what you used for the yeah so just put the size all right oh i dont think i submitted yeah uh i used count whatever youre iterating its gonna end up being count is less than array size divided by two is there an exit form change arrays now no it didnt even say to print the last one yeah i dont yeah or you get docked wait start is no start is inaudible  i got that right oh youre probably index out of balance so start is wrong so it should be wrong so it should not be yeah i mean thats how mine looked yeah all right let me try to get to the bus you good i think ive lost any of these no idea th all right okay i think i  yeah this size inaudible  and we just need another folder i is less than b minus plus  all right inaudible  all right i think i did it i dont know how to do this im trying to print out the array but its not working okay screw it i am doing this inaudible  yeah its printing a reference i forget how to get the actual object okay yeah im done i just outputted the array you have to switch to dimension one and dimension  right now yeah inaudible  array out of bounds so run it again i dont know im going to check yours out once i finish mine but im basically almost done you can try switching dimension one and dimension two then thats the only thing i can think  in your folder thats fucking weird all right maximum average parameter all right just do a minus one do a minus one thats that wouldnt work i dont  want to ask david it only gives you the inaudible  screw that up because you get the two dimensions from that right and then that sets those as the  zero we gave it minus one hows that crosstalk  mine is like that thats pretty much what mine looks like its a weird one what im basically done yeah yeah oh inaudible  yeah i got you okay cool all right basically its how you pace that inaudible  no you inaudible  fill it out yeah basically all you do is  lets see so i made a new array and averaged both inaudible  the second value and i basically just switched the second value for the first value so instead dimension twos on the outside and dimension one on the inside that should do it mmhmm affirmative and you have to do that inaudible  loop too yeah close that check into the inaudible  hmm so you go at manual entry manual entry and then bracket dimension two dimension one yeah hmm so go back to your first folder and  wait what are you trying to print print the array first you got to print the array all right really they made it confusing its really not yeah its not inaudible  try to implement this right inaudible  yeah the inaudible  you just copypaste the first loop wait what are you trying to  i mean that works just do it outside the print no you have to swap them yeah these are inaudible  oh you dont use dimension one and dimension two you use j crosstalk  the average oh i screwed up you got to switch them you got to switch inaudible  yeah thats why it  yeah i think dimension one yeah dimension two okay so i j i add i i  i plus one no j plus one yeah j  no just j because it goes from zero to  hang on wait size of the column would be inaudible  yeah this one is on the inside thats like the vertical  thats how im interpreting it that was basically all formatting yeah but weve done that before all right so basically all this is is inaudible  basically the same loop over and over again hmm wait you have to have an outside folder check for inaudible  value yeah pretty much done  all right i was trying to do something with inaudible  silence inaudible  here here here  yeah  that one and then that i think we were supposed to do the average yeah silence yeah inaudible  over here and over here im wearing a wire right now im wearing a wire silence crosstalk  easy line up that  yeah  all right im done with the second part  well no  no let me ask him that two three two three four five six  six seven   divided by six is wait what yeah right the as  were objects and in this is passed by reference  all right crosstalk  wait you dont have to  thats fine as long as i i try to get it out around the time the bus comes because im not walking all the way across campus times  plus okay wheres the ash key  table ash key im just going to do lower case letters crosstalk   there probably is if you do it outside yeah if you yeah do it in the class  for character or like what characters do you want  all right  thats done all right i finished the character aim it was really simple it was literally the same thing as the ant  area i take out that and change your ra to character and change and put that next to mathrandom and then pass it through  yeah basically what im about to do is im just going to copypaste this search character so yeah basically your body is going to stay the same yeah you might have to change the huh thats weird m characters oh wow thats it so i can filter m characters crosstalk  i need the oh yeah no i did double i dont think it matters there  yeah yeah but i guess the other stuff weve done is basically the same structure we just crosstalk  different things from that structure because all these go through every element and the range   so im actually done crosstalk   equals yeah yeah  it doesnt matter if were it doesnt matter for methods  yeah return value crosstalk  all right methods all right so if crosstalk  yeah just inaudible  all right  i didnt hear it  for i returned it  i dont think it matters though  all right  what  oh wait i dont need two inaudible  and then array array plus two then crosstalk  sum is two  its slightly more difficult than what we did before aw man i have to  yeah  okay search equals inaudible  crosstalk  oh oh oh oh i was doing something really stupid  hold on i was trying to do the second method when i was supposed to do the first  so its yeah times  i think it was plus  yep thats what i put  all right thats good  oh fuck crosstalk  oh okay yep mmhmm affirmative crosstalk  does not equal  in this crosstalk  nine all right i think i am done one one three thats good two two arrange inaudible  zero at the top lower  ah crosstalk   one one wait im going to search for a all right all right i think thats it i should probably output the arrays though  output the array  yeah wait what where did my thing go  control c  ah okay so this is what im going to do inaudible  out to print there should be crosstalk  plus one space plus crosstalk  okay and then control c  review it looks inaudible   i had the wrong ash key  values yeah value  i put the hedge value not the decimal value so its actually   two and two two three four five each side of this work here everything is zero to three equal okay yeah so i am done now yeah  so its really the same thing as well you when you assign the value to i and j i personally did it through the inaudible   you cant return two values so array one put this in there  and youre going to pass back inaudible   no no  this times two  yeah  so value zero would be the i value  yeah just put value  yeah oh okay then you break and you go down  oh i didnt put it dumb ass in your outside folder so down here no one more then view it if index of search zero does not equal negative one yeah no you break yeah  you have to do it twice because if not itll keep going to the folder down here no you dont yeah this index search zero  you can in array  what i got it it happened to me earlier i put the wrong i didnt have boxes in front of that and i was trying to return an array  the array hmm all this does is you break out of the second four loop but that is going to break on its own if its not in there  so you initialize your first initial search through negative one for both values whatd you think of the test today yeah  you had the whole page of determinants you know im pretty sure you can type it into your calculator like to get it so that a determinant equals five i had five   yeah aac and ii  yeah  i only screwed up on the times   yeah at first i was going to put  yeah  yeah so it was  i think  yeah yeah five times  to the third  all right good i dont think it was as bad as the last test really i struggled crosstalk  yeah i didnt do good on the last one howd you do on the first one thats what i did i dont know i think this one should be yeah im not too sure on some of the basis stuff  yeah  yeah the column space is the one i had a bit of trouble  yeah i think i accidentally did the null space twice on one of the platforms  but it shouldnt be that bad  yeah  nah i think differential equations was harder top two  was harder  next semester  really i had ap stats back in high school and it was all calculator its basically linear algebra but with instead of the matrix functions you scale it to averages means medians stuff like that  all right i have cool all right ,right  average  average  right  think  understand  location  greater  yep  four  six  yeah  whoop  wait  sorting  yeah  yeah  see  wait  index  equal  mmhmm  affirmative  thats  index  like  panel  whatever  cant  use  index  need  another  variable  use  count  count  use  index  thing  youre  iterating  index  plus  plus  youll  uh  count  equal  index  whatever  youre  viewing  yeah  uh  wait  wait  shuffle  element  short  array  target  dont  know  last  one  supposed  hm  need  least  well  need  least  many  element  guarantee  well  technically  need  many  element  guarantee  enough  space  array  since  dont  whether  beforehand  imply  better  use  vector  vector  java  since  array  cant  change  yeah  probably  vector  uh  side  two  target  something  okay  think  im  done  uhhuh  affirmative  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  need  separate  variable  high  number  j  im  assuming  want  like  consecutive  like  certain  index  uh  yeah  yeah  um  zero  four  average  three  okay  thats  there  size  four  size  three  last  two  thats  odd  low  want  oh  thats  thats  yeah  right  oh  size  dont  know  im  getting  wrong  though  oh  didnt  thats  right  yeah  didnt  reset  value  yeah  annoying  though  n  target  equal  write  use  variable  tied  size  use  used  yeah  put  size  right  oh  dont  think  submitted  yeah  uh  used  count  whatever  youre  iterating  gon  na

thats good does this one open ah i know right sorry i thought i was weak for a second i was like am i that weak where i cant pry this  wait does yours have this stick this is draped over my leg okay so brute force isnt working out at all i dont know what else to do with it okay oh okay which recording do you guys have crosstalk  get my paper my paper fell cause the weight of the cords sorry is skyler not here aight is the first one just a word or you can type a paragraph when you said enter the string it counts the vowels you got to enter like oh yeah  index or contains what shes asking for is the code with the numbers including letters ascii code she said ascii code is it theremember we did a license plate and you looked up the  code is that was ascii code is in like the method right the for loops and the different methods right all right okay well before right though if it was in compiler i know theres no way its more than one watch it be six inaudible  oh you didnt screw it now so the ones with periods are methods i only got one i think well get them next time we should feel real next time im guessing you resorted to guessing we were joking watch it be five or six can you send it a picture picture can you send it cause my phones likewill you send screenshot pictures remember you were like what is this inaudible  this sounds really bad already its cause i highlighted it i think what assignment is this called what number is this it would count it plus one i got it i got it i think i can handle three what activity is this for what activity is this  i inaudible  for  it would be funny if we sounded similar but they could tell our voices inaudible  inside shit its in the book i forgot it will tell you in the book how to do it why is this so clinky im trying to do that for loop thing what crosstalk  string you use to find the crosstalk  the thing to find the vowels yeah yeah but i just copied the if thing the other one was the letter crosstalk  it  why is this wrong you cant crosstalk  this how do i turn this off  this one doesnt open gotcha   this is this is asking  report  it says prop user enter now you fucked up the fudge word okay what did that say generating a random number  thats kind of funny honestly i mean but well add later to it yeah i have class  okay yeah i can make it there the max the max getting the max number yeah you said we cast it to ten  inaudible do we cast mathrandom  and multiply it by  you get zero to nine oh my god hey can you look in inaudible  mathrandom and see if it makes sense oh do you have to crosstalk  what if it doesnt work two three four   six seven eight nine  what it just says zero for me zero zero zero zero zero zero zzz  idubbbz the one who does content cops but can you help me do my mathrandom one second one second just let me print this out how how do you print this out you  just print out the source crosstalk  inaudible  source dot dot like source uh the crosstalk  had to go onto  you have to create a forloop that its going  yes yes thats what i have through this one why does mine not work mine says zero zero zero zero zero you should of just called it source yeah fuck then everything has to be source i still got ten though so it worked the other way wait is this a menu you used to do or is it just like i was just doing it like this you dont reference the but theres just zeros on mine see look zero zero zero zero thats for the max yeah theyre gonna print out anything i was just testing the first one and then i was looking  like  cause i already did almost three so i was like checking to see if it worked can you see the mathrandom first wheres error in here seriously are you starbucks basic  spent like five dollars for this much meh okay crosstalk  youre excused oh my god listen its on site honestly i dont want like this much for five dollars crosstalk  what where this must be  you changed it to that i  rest in size oh see  no see it doesnt compile like that like my old way did it no i was gonna undo it and then fix from mathrandom i dont know lets undo everything i was gonna press control z everything still the same oh the period  maybe its this one my array is my array wrong just erase it maybe you dont want it to be sideways for this one four its easier to see the recoils oh like so here could do like cast it to n and thatll work oh okay so you can just keep this as double or just the mathrandoms wrong im saying it was like that before thats what i was trying to say i was doing that for  spaces because i was doing mine sideways oh did he leave me oh okay oh no oh this versions from the book so i oh well lets just try it and then ok oh ill change it ill change it yea it really does not matter what we call it okay ill just change it its no big deal yeah doesnt really matter what this is called  anyways crosstalk  wheres the problem wheres the problem in this one where it has an x right there wait what why is it inaudible  inaudible  touch his baby  crosstalk  samsung sucks im just kidding im trying to get back to where it was just chill the book my second ones wrong oh you changed it and now its wrong you shut the  i had to do the  whatd you change my source sourcelength ill kill you oh yeah its illegal to curse right whatd you fill my count at what oh yeah thats inaudible  why are you bulling me today why are you bullying me i dont even know the load max probably stick to zero somewhere in here crosstalk  source i only looked at like the first a okay so js gonna be the value of the max value  square roots found oh nope is this wrong somehow im not sure cause it just like prints out multiple numbers im just trying to figure out  why its wrong oh i cant see the scroll bar yeah yeah look see theres two oh oh shooting your movies wait is this due tonight does your cousin like watch every movie huh maybe do l the loop oh no crosstalk  im just gonna leave then said im just gonna leave im doing this we can oh okay we can what did you like not get oh yeah print those inaudible  combos yeah yeah were all like where the stairs were we like did real fast oh im  crosstalk  yeah i feel you on that wait was kyler doing isnt he working on his game skylers working on his game yeah yeah with his friends so like at zero pccc oh okay i was going to try to figure this out real quick so today is april nd   yeah yeah i think its right alright cause it returns the answers in here right so it compiles the values into those right  yeah thats what it does right wait is it part five oh part five never mind  so part five is where you put in these two numbers right put in this method this is  part five right is it index when crosstalk  the method returns in array of the arrays return isnt the inside called index though  which one look at here when it returns result it just does the indexes of it right you dont have to go with mine if you dont want to it seems like you really dont like that one answer empty array different array part   yeah this is footing values in the indexes right so wed like result of j what are these arrow things he made array called list in the parameter because it starts from zero yeah because you know how zero one two three four five when the length is eight  its actually at the seventh index because it starts from zero you understand what i mean  because then this is actually at seven inaudible  like the  crosstalk  what do you mean you go back there for a second i just want to understand it so its saying if i equals  zero j equals  minus one if i is less than the list of length crosstalk  yeah you create an array in this parameter the list a new array could result  yeah this must meet up in the middle what so you can pass arrays by invoking method a method may also return array for  example the inaudible  returns the array that is the reversal of the other array ones actually the other you fill alpha one  alpha index you flip the one you think and then well see whos right actually you might be right how many is it one two three four  yeah it might be  value i think youre right  oh wait i thought crosstalk  but theres only like five crosstalk  crosstalk  letters wait whatd you put for five crosstalk  after the lines  whatd he get after the line is compiled crosstalk  part three after the line compile  yeah thats makes sense right after these all compile they like go in for like zero one two three  was index right oh no silence oh i forgot to change fucking four and five thats okay i missed four and five i changed three but i forgot to change five this is  points for an argument of inaudible  the value of the argument is a  inaudible  array referent values passive and method inaudible  inaudible   describe as pass by sharing the area of the method is the blank as the  yeah silence before the method call what is the value of a  yeah  wheres the method call at wheres method call do you see it why is it not named like a call wheres the method call okay when we work on this one right crosstalk  when we work on this one okay i got you give me a sec  crosstalk   oh i think this is easier than they make it out to be  fives  silence oh this is call alright b zero before  its gonna be six yep so before call is over here in this one then this is the call one this is inside method call so this is called call they label it for you dont they see yeah the side of method m  this is method m the side of method m right because this is what its called é think about what would be displayed when we get the inaudible  nom  equal one what is it nom of one is three  crosstalk  and then a  it has to be crosstalk  we think its  i dont know i dont see where it calls eight again i think its  im a put that fuck it because its getting too late crosstalk  crosstalk  because it doesnt say it it doesnt have the option for  because look do you want me to show you which one five to two b is zero is five  and then this inaudible  zero is two so five to two after method call is two cause you put a b into m right cause this is after method right here right yeah which ones number two ten five six one two three two  listen im just going to go with how inaudible  ten and two  crosstalk  i think its true isnt it  alright scroll  thats not the one  what nothings  crosstalk  yeah we did first one  crosstalk  false thats my reference copies and values and make a copy im really sorry for  we our condolences crosstalk  not in the scope its whatever  is there an exit form yeah right  okay did you all get the answers yet yeah he hit us up last night or they thought you were gone yeah he missed you a lot  yeah inaudible  and put like david with a little heart david inaudible  heart  theres like a new ta oh so this is one then the value three four its just one ill need to retrace the steps  all right make sure ive only done my shit im not even there  wait what did you get for number nine  ball a ball but theres no six here no wait where oh i answered it wrong my bad okay is this a binary search oh my bad i fucking hate this recorder  i know hes dropping yeah i just had no sleep im sorry  he starts crying yo whats up with ten you have ten  i like the code for like the binary because linear says you can do one or you can do power of one array is but binary search youre always going to do like seventy steps what are you pulling out  what are you pulling out   didnt mean that  yeah his dinner which is dude your bags og and now go look at   small first all right now eight fortyfour  or eight eight four  eight eight four mmhmm  affirmative section  point  so just look at the section more than anything  wait why is yours messed up is this adobe  no what are you talking about ive never had that problem  like the theory whatever  i dont no yeah  four a bubble sorts the array in you just answered it smallest a bubble sorts an array in blank  a bubble sorts an array in blank just go to  thats the section  i think trust the section more than anything sorts the array in blank so what is blank  it would have to be in this section  is either a single or multiple a multiple or a single a multiple or a single  it was right in front of our face if it was a snake it would bite us  i dont know do you actually have to watch this video  five three twoeight they swapoh is it the one where like they test a first one then the second one then the third one because look they swapped it for thei fucking hate this i think i know how to do this one see how they swapped the first one because its missing this  swapped it  theyre testing one and zero  goddammit  which one  what is four  multiples or singles oh so this one  headphones thatd be annoying hearing double in your voice  its like having two twitch streams open huh  wait these two are the same for me though  three two five eight three two five eight  two three five  eight  seven nine eight  the third one number three can you say it for me david david come here i need you i dont know how to use this   six because i had to go to my tas office hours because i have a huge test on thursday april th say yours again say yours okay want me to show the pdf my computer just shows up in every single mistake you can think of okay whats its name mia  is that supposed to be telling us the size of it or no is that supposed to be telling us whats in the array or the size of the array yeah is that generating random numbers in the array or is it supposed to tell us like i dont know thats going to be what the size or the values of it all right print the array of the right formatting print the array of the right formatting for example if this row whats that supposed to be just we are so youre inaudible  these xs look at the thing look is it something like that i forgot i cant tell you do you put that in the for loop so it makes a random one i dont know okay right here right main array crosstalk  or more importantly the fact that this is all justifiable after it shouldnt be all right you should be able to do this quickly fix it but oh okay yeah thats true no yeah well i looked out this girl inaudible  like both of them this nested for loop the book the column and the row row yep arraylength whatever your array is thats opposite yep let me see what it looks like what the hell it fixed itself if you put a nested for loop in it does it specify how many rows and columns it is what does the error say local variable has not been initialized oh i put this part i did it inaudible  like that thing im just sleepy yeah well thats why this is the because this is just for getting the random numbers but i havent initialized the length or anything so i dont know how whats the length supposed to be i dont know i havent made the ive indexed it like how long is it supposed to be the length i dont know how do you know what the array is supposed to be are you going to try to print it but its not going to print anything inaudible  send out anything yeah how long are the arrays supposed to be in this how long is the array supposed to be yeah oh the length separate what  or no  i mean or  yeah thats right  you out are you inaudible  it was  he says he could do it by  it was easy hes dead he didnt sleep last night hey q why is this out of bounds i made a for loop to generate random numbers for this one and this one i just tried to make their own column random i think i made this okay but its out of bounds when i try to run it is it oh its right it runs but sometimes its out of bounds when i run this sometimes its okay but sometimes it gives me out of bounds oh all right thank you oh okay just the first couple of parts i havent done the sum of it or anything yet i dont think the mathrandom is right for mine but it should be right otherwise generates the random row and column you know what i mean making random numbers in the rows yeah were making progress do you see inaudible  the only thing that still might be wrong is the mathrandom but the rest should be right you got it this is the for loop to print it you do column its basically the same for loop besides this part really just copy this part this is to print it out this is just to make the math its like one through what which one its the same exact thing but you just do row column plus space yeah for row and column to print out both of them maybe im trying to see if this is right i was supposed to get you that energy drink so youd be amped up get amped up dude it seems like youre dying only  games of league crosstalk   minutes sometimes not really is this already late if this is already late im leaving is this already late if this is already late im just leaving it doing it some other time because theres already a deduction no matter if i finish in the next  minutes or before  tomorrow yeah which one so its the same for loops or you put the same for loops nope thirteen thirteen what does your first four loop look like what does your first four loop look like it doesnt work looks random still trying to get a make it like two by two and then circle or like three by three i mean you could do that but it wouldnt be that hard it would take two seconds,thats  good  one  open  ah  know  right  sorry  thought  weak  second  like  weak  cant  pry  wait  stick  draped  leg  okay  brute  force  isnt  working  dont  know  else  okay  oh  okay

 just checking if it works yeah it opens it opens just keep uh putting pressure on it  crosstalk  oh you locked it i dont know it would open yeah it doesnt open yeah youre just going to have to hold it drop the mic drop the mic cause every time you finish a line of code you just drop it im just kidding stop take this seriously are you guys interested in try to figure out probably its locked or something thats what i noticed so put this here for a sec okay look mine opens what if you scream at it you scare it and its open thats what a microphone does its broken it just doesnt clip open this one just deal with it hold it  you look like a badass tv host doesnt give a fuck his mic is just dangling ah its gonna fall where you going yeah wonder nice wires it hurts itself in its confusion hold on okay ill put this on my pocket okay as in crosstalk  are you telling him to enter a string thats an output so thats a parallelogram are you asking him to enter a string okay so its a parallelogram and then when you get a string its almost a process so i think our input so input would belets research them again but im pretty sure the first one if youre asking him something youre outputting a message your system goes out its always index  index what i dont think so its more ofif it exists just put a counter if its not this one its probably this one lets work on two together i finished number one crosstalk  inaudible  i think so no no listen just do the flow chart and do the inaudible  code andbut the codes right there ill show you how thats bullshit though im just kidding not really it doesnt make sense what if you use the same name for something and just keeps giving a compiler error its just four now think about it but if you want to put five put five four what its bullshit dude im so failing all of these i feel  oh my god man no before because it from zero to four because it should be less than five local variable lineand  no dude its a signature its a signature trust me im just kidding you actually was gonna im just kidding but it sounds like it it sounds like it theres only one inaudible  yeah its probably six watch it be another option down there we just didnt see im parched im thirsty im gonna get some water wow what is going on even when were just joking and we say its probably going to be eight it was fucking five no yes no no no no actually youre right theres a small select few  i think got over three same crosstalk  what yeah how much did you get from theshit we were like but you know what a method was i thought a method was just like the thing that goesyeah yeah its probably eight and i was like okay do you want to copy this send it oh from my phone okay i swear i swear its almost like if youyou know in certain prisons theythey whats up with my phone now so its g right so instead of entering a letter make a set of variables that if it was o or u or a or i you just need to add one more thing to it okay instead of having an if statement that counts nothing you know how over here i had to input a word right that gets taken out or not taken out occurrences enter inaudible  counted occurrences or the last vowel u yeah you would count that so just the flow track for it its very easy huh crosstalk  from today youre  inaudible  sounds like i dont know if you know enough inaudible  for this do you know that the inaudible  just give me a sec are these the parameters but what do you put you put string and something or are these parameters are these the parameters its what gets put in over here in the can i put the variable of an input can i put these two down here okay okay yeah i got you david question since this is crosstalk  how do i set the parameter to this you know how like it takes a string first and then integer you just type in string that works just type  why doesnt it work is there  thats right return zero lets say what was it inaudible  or return two can i use more than one method unnecessary because problem two wants us to use what happened how hes cheating you need to write the crosstalk  method and something that takes in two right i got the input for the first one all mmhmm affirmative zero is it supposed to return more than yeah first it was an int thats impossible unless it is not  how will that take in a parameter of a string and a integer crosstalk  i tried making the capital  for this then this is doesnt the main method include everything this is an extra one right oh ok ok this is the class one right i have another question right now if i entered lets say hello world and then  it will take hello world then  right because of the integers i was thinking of void i was thinking of putting in void so i put just text in the index and what about this yeah it is it is the return value that crosstalk  for  what if youre returning than just a integer what if im returning a string that got edited right now i have to split this i have to split this right if you can … if i can return more than just an integer yeah yeah yeah true true true i need to return it split into two i need to return it twice then instead of a zero id return no yeah thats what i was thinking so a void does not need a return that is exactly what i wanted now whats the void value exactly it doesnt return anything can it crosstalk  something so i can call it back  so it does return something int or index in there i figure out the loop ok and then instead of taking it back to the main one i can do system inaudible  print the okay gotcha thank you so much you doing two are you doing two nyah be like fuck this im sorry i didnt mean to say the f word were being recorded double trouble  you have you figured out number  can you show me did you physically go through the index and then click a space and then move to the next line quick question can we use sub strings no yeah thanks im sorry inaudible  then what do we use kind of can you just explain that again i run it i run it until its less than two less than index then plus plus right on  print character until oh okay okay char at i i do this and then i put system to auto print text like this then the other ones going to be inside this too okay got you oh okay okay i just copy this all right thanks inaudible  getting hard nah its fine inaudible  j  string to find the vowels you can make if a or if u or if o or if e or if i then count this one i dont know thats something you could use did you copy the thing i told you yeah put a crosstalk  outside thats the thing we took today and we messed up for the first one yeah did you finish the second one im stuck too so when i figure it out ill tell you did ethan just leave did he finish did he finish ethan i can get it from him in a way are you taylor alright okay entry equals two  yeah yeah yeahinaudible  im like loaded its like were crosstalk  to let the character  where the index is right the second one you still put it less than right thats what i wanted to see thank you wait i cant see that if text dot index inaudible  yes but why is there an error you what its not a boolean though i have no idea give me a second hey morgan what happened when you printed it up though what did you print out listen since this is attached to me ill come over i have both low key i might blow up your brain farting just give me a sec which one crosstalk  bye guys we dont need to get input right  did you just say inaudible  yeah this sound like we curs each other out inaudible  this is what im gonna do im gonna pull out one of the strings thats not gonna work for the inaudible  run do you just multiple by nine because really the minimum is just zero right yeah its max minus minimum minus minimum plus one or something i dont know right it would be one minus one ten minus one inaudible  ethan ethan shes in the group try to get her in the circle inaudible  to her yes yeah exactly inaudible  but so did you guys multiple by nine what are you doing  i’m not sure it beats crocs honestly inaudible  did you oh fuck crosstalk  do you remember when he was wearing the inaudible  jeans i really like that inaudible  honestly true true that should have been yes extra credit for that morgan yeah one second one second so okay so ill show you what i did how do you declare im not sure what i did one  look so since he puts his own size right how do you make it go through every single neutralization of this gosh it makes so much sense now okay but how do i make the size increase he can be printing zero zero zero every  crosstalk  so listen i made it by less than size right but how do i choose the index to make  so im made the third loop right that loops every single time to be less than the size  single time okay so lets say i want him to print out zero then one then two then three not zero for inaudible  amounts i counted i plus plus right yeah yeah inaudible  yeah yeah inaudible  goes to i yes yes yes yes that works but listen this time we go we code then us no no yeah crosstalk  yeah when me a morgan were talking but were gonna have some prepared questions and well have not a time limit but well do them by the time and after were done were just chilling literally yeah yeah yeah were gonna pick from the last three chapters i pushed them from the last two chapters four through seven yeah thats actually perfect exactly crosstalk  so it gives me this error cant convert into brackets huh what day  on wednesday i have class like  minutes after that yeah true true true so if its convenient for most of you guys then go for it yeah those are the best times so after one of our classes most of us are free theres one class and then the other class is just some people have it some people dont so its giving me this error of no its saying something cannot convert into array i just want the im just trying to make a loop that goes through all the sizes so like he puts in  okay and then so the size is like inaudible  number but i dont want it to print out only one size i want it to go through all the sizes go through all the numbers like      so you see how you need to make a random number for each one so i want to be able to set to  to a random number  to a random number exactly oh okay so the index not a random number i want it to increase with the loop thats why i made a loop so this should be  because the inaudible  number below  right right and then but you still want it to look hmmokay yeahright i got you right so since this is  okay but i want it to  i want it to know inaudible  from source  oh so source is the name right dont really need to use any more right the loop is already powered up by that sizeand then size is just the number and we just use this number to create the loop we  yeah yeah yeah and in a way we kind of dont even need size anymore right right one more question since theres inaudible  right do i just multiple by nine since its like the minimum is zero so like max minus minimum plus minimum plus one or something zero nine yeah times  okay inaudible  great thank you that works what inaudible  i kind of exit out of the library inaudible  i cant open anything inaudible  thank you wait what have you finished inaudible  the what im working on the random so you finished b keep up that work okay im almost done with a im actually done with a what happened to everyone inaudible  can you repeat that yeah thats what he told me and i was kind of thinking of that but instead of multiplying by  multiply by  i dont know if i tell you what im doing youre gonna hate me im too lazy to write inaudible  random so im looking through all my other… dude no but trust me its gonna pay off when i just have to copy paste oh thats the future i actually cant find it does it run found it part a i finished part a crosstalk  i guess i didnt finish part a i guess i forgot to print out  it looks it looks pretty good you miss idubbbz thats not the only reason hes like  okay maybe thats the only reason people know about him but i know him from filthy frank but do i just search in source hey how do you display an array how do you display an array you just go like  alright im in a four loop right but like yeah okay thank you thank you ill be with you in a second ramon can i run this on this cross crosstalk  it gosh darn worked thats not it why oh its supposed to be called source okay you didnt use println right honestly it looks much more neater but if you have preferences of that im not gonna tell you anything the little max equals to yeah im gonna do it like that what do you mean not reference the what  so you print a right whats this for then you didnt finish it why didnt it work why didnt it run yeah and how did the index of max is equals to zero its always zero so youre always asking the max to be bigger than zero right the index of max is nine wait what im confused so hold on let me see and i was counting no we can  hold on give me a second its actually the best shit out there crosstalk  starbucks is better than dunkin donuts listen listen  one time i took this before class and i just keep seeing him taking it right i actually like did stuff in class i take starbucks like every now and then nothing happens crosstalk  wait you actually fix that thing did it run what channel what channel yes he puts in  right so whats the point in web scale  like you do that only for strength but here they already gave you  you already told them how many numbers are in this right so its just to make it much more  but can i say something now this one doesnt like this is my way  inaudible  way no no no where are you going whats up with your mathrandom its the same thing as mine its always  okay okay i equals to this is zero  okay  i tried to put like the mine and it still doesnt run okay times  im just looking like actually  you did the exact same thing yours gotta work now no no no no  theres something wrong what this one will that work okay one second you didnt set  you didnt set  okay next what  one second what the f you can have it sideways  im sorry for like inaudible  im just inaudible   this myself i look like okay thats number one number two number three crosstalk  that way but your code is identical to mine i dont know why you have this problem you wanna change isnt  like this and  oh i was doing this and trying to do his way but its like almost the same way i tried to change it the same way he has an error there is it cause of this gotcha cast it to gotcha hey thank you no no thats the reason why oh lets go in  oh my god did you not put a fuckin  i cant believe you oh my god this is  what part are you guys in crosstalk  where did like ethan and  really they just finished what part are you guys on part what oh im part b crosstalk  you skipped z crosstalk  oh alright so you tell me what i do here yeah i changed to nine are you sure that im right put it back to zero okay then turn the systems on show me what happens okay how can you use i twice change inaudible  this is probably gonna cause problems no no no i dont know how you didnt get a promo already like when i make a list i have inti intj this is gonna cause you problems like do stuff like you  like has been known to cause some stuff where show me what the inaudible  products  no this is cancel how do you like go up is it like you did that not me fuckin mother fuckin im sorry im sorry i just get like this is like touch though right no it doesnt work oh perfect so i can point with this now i know a use for it but so where did you copy this from where are you  what part are you in this is roam around please like roam around check some no no im just like  i can help you with the first one  second one thats where weve reached you know no i didnt change anything you shut the oh okay oh thats why thats why alright crosstalk  oh my god shut the fuck up alright okay weve been cursing a lot buddy do you know theyre like gonna sue us for this students  have you not read the student book crosstalk  no youre not  allowed to curse more than three times and you should excuse yourself after each  time theyre gonna have to censor this theyre gonna have bleeps and stuff no youre bullying me crosstalk  no you told me you studied the arrays im like okay this is actually nice curiousjust  carry it on im really sleepy today when am i not sleepy what did you guys do for part b yeah another four loopcrosstalk  same as part a sames as part a no no no i mean source i  i mean source j equals to eight crosstalk  inaudible  this goes to nine like the max value goes to nine okay oh so youre comparing okay but we already know that nine is the biggest value so oh i wanna do all like four exactly oh okay makes sense im just doing lap top what is in preview okay so why is not mean to  oh if i see one crosstalk  so how do you print out the index then alright well get it right yeah you need to  know which ones actually oh so i print out i next to the j crosstalk  yeah okay no is the inaudible  and js the value of whats the max value can you see  that like okay i is like the index right of like the whole thing its actually size okay  then j is the one like we compare with the max value to see if its the highest value  right but we need to know at what point was it the highest value thats where i shows  up at i j was this and it was the max value m crosstalk  what happens if you have more than one max value cause she  said we wanted more than one index so at some point were gonna need more than  one nine showed up you know what i mean crosstalk  yeah yeah yeah  look look find the maximum value of any of them showing the value of the next set  value so if you had like two nine youre gonna print one and ignore the other one  crosstalk  true i was thinking of looping something that kind of goes through  everyone and then if it is it just prints it out oh yeah exactly but thats just like hey lets  we can ask if this is what needs to be  done seems very excessive did you figure it out why youre printing out the index of max is it always increasing go down go down go  down scroll down through the console yes dude you figured it out so it was two then three then five like okay go up wait  no these  are these random numbers are these the random numbers from i theres a seven theres a nine i cant do this tomorrow i have to go to another movie dude i hate movies huh when is this due no no no  huh no no no tonight its tonight like exactly yeah now hes a movie fanatic hes going to see wolves scary  he knows almost  every director every editor like you know he knows every movie thats coming out  every move that came out at states but its fun he always offers to pay for mine so im  like okay ill go but i wouldnt pay for this anyways crosstalk  no i think class is over huh okay you know what we should do crosstalk  we should do this together we dont like go through parts you know what i mean we go through like every part  together yeah you dipped were like waiting for you literally outside yeah and you just went then like youre like fuck this shit  cant curse next to it oh no but like how did you do crosstalk  no like im  i think really okay what about under  crosstalk  okay shit okay lets see crosstalk  yeah right now skylers working on his game they have us for like  minutes and it might actually open is yours open april nd  so last one compiles i think theres like  i would suggest something better but this is like what i thinkcrosstalk  really yeah yeah yeah its like the only out of  when you come in our cancellation like you do to conflict like cancellation multiple cho  what the kay listen got it got it yep why whats up whats part three then yeah okay lets leave this for a second fill in the blank when a method returns an array  okay we have to open the book for this one  better be safe than like guessing especially with this one that we can know oh  inaudible  drew repeat the question whats the section about its point  what   okay  silence point  silence in your array inaudible  can you read me the question again for me youre right with the index part but lets just be sure thats all  i think i read it but im not sure if thats the one  look heres  one second here   right you can pass arrays when working inaudible  method may also  return an array im not gonna say which one show me yeah the three and five we didnt know about four i think its crosstalk  okay okay well do that well type in index but lets read the array result so we know  the function returns a new array why not value though it just returns index it  depends on the curve time like if youre asking it to return  are you sure its only from point  when a method returns in array the index of the array  okay no im just like if its possible to make  crosstalk  yeah cause it just doesnt make sense as in like why would you return an index of the  value you put this in the method and you do something to the values of the method  why would you just return the index unless you or specifically asking it “hey when  does nine show up in the array” you know what i mean i see it makes sense if you  want to put index but its only if you specifically ask the return but i could be wrong i  didnt study  so we just look line two creates a new array right line four to seven “copy elements from array list to array list a result” yeah if you return one  like whats he gonna know from  if you return two hes not  gonna know anything from it return result nah these are going down  okay lets go through this alright public static inaudible  okay he made an  array and its the stop length okay for inaudible  length minus one whats up with minus one you guys  did it over there so you want it start from minus one right but why did you put plus one instead of minus one youre saying if it starts from  zero crosstalk  oh okay say it me so just the output were just changing the output if we put plus  one it plus one it will be index eight keep it there its just going to keep falling off okay and for inaudible  zero j equals the  result  okay i equals i understand the stop length i plus plus  its just weird okay  its completing  whys there two conditions oh no  we set this to that  silence so i increases and this keeps decreasing and then unique result j which is the thing we  set here our result of j equals this list of  wheres list we didnt create list  oh there we go result is list not length and list is something we got  isnt the mean  method this like a method just a method as it is yeah so this is array this is the value of index this is just the index of  oh  remember how we returned a number to a method and this made it the right size   onbecause its size so imagine list is seven okay we put in seven here seven keeps  decreasing i keeps increasing and set result  yes exactly thats inaudible  here lets go here and keep going until they hit  the middle are we returning index or are we returning like value reversal so  exactly youre gonna say  when the method returns an array  sure i mean  lets ask around why should we  wait value doesnt work  hold up we dont know because we checked the book and it still didnt tell us one  second  wait whatd you guys put for question three like the first part  was it index or value like when the method returns an array the blank reference  so is that index in a way where is in the book we looked for it ive  control f it doesnt work i know ive tried this before like its  crosstalk  crosstalk  so what does reference mean like it returns the values would the index those are the indexes so why would we return the  okay this is not a question we can ask now then part five what is it  okay after the line is combined  okay were really going to go with this after the lines come five you want to show your answers yeah what was it what did you put in we can  what  crosstalk  empty different array returning  okay thank you thank you guys  but how is it  okay im just going to ask him about this later  array is set to a different … hes a yes it was a yes  it was a yes wait what  dont click yes dont click yes so this is the correct answer here no crosstalk  no its this  part five wrong and part three is  kind of yeah true no its reference okay we need to put inaudible  of like here silence which one why how did you  did you get the answers for page  silence yeah  i have the book open just tell me  function for inaudible  the value for  silence okay read the question to me and i will tell you what do put in because ill read it with you is a  reference  comma tell me when theres a blank same its the same  so its referencing same right okay use the codes above for the next few questions god dammit its another one of  the part a and part  no no its not its  right on a on a b its basically here like a  thats true its not returning anything  do i put this  copy this  watch  silence which one no first one yeah were doing it  i mean  this is why were supposed  to help each other thats what  so look i ran the inaudible  i ran it so go through a b in order before the call is five  b one before call  makes sense okay so heres the thing crosstalk  okay and then  inaudible   whats over is this new question what about the inaudible  crosstalk  yeah nom of zeros gonna be two  what if its a trick question go up  whats the point okay my bad the nom of three is three its three i mean inside the method  do they want after  crosstalk  i dont know no after method a youre right its  the weird thing is why did this turn to five to two  okay yeah i know but im talking about the after method call after method call is two yeah  crosstalk  okay are you  right we put a a doesnt change we put b and b changes lets just put two or if they ask for it show me the ones on top yeah five six right okay and then  inaudible   want to ask right there  come on like im running out of inaudible  quickly quickly quick  crosstalk  theres not point were being inaudible  this one is crosstalk   inaudible   space crosstalk  no  like okay  and then  this one past reference yeah that one click click  copies  and then the values its  for a second  makes up french   crosstalk  i know i saw it coming  crosstalk  thanks inaudible  what are you doing why whats up crosstalk  one second one second yeah real quick  inaudible   okay  okay nine  copies the values okay i wish we studied for this inaudible  how did we get something wrong crosstalk  it wasnt two  then you know once again i apologize for what weve done  which what thing like studying inaudible  yes and well prepare some questions we can  time flies ive lost track of time a week ago one second  okay wheres the exit point crosstalk  wheres the exit point crosstalk   i have a poem because you were absent pull up the music crosstalk  yeah so theres nothing in this world i wouldnt trade it for you david your help is top rated you got me baby youre welcome  no were good no honestly there was like no sleep yesterday  hes not coming back he thinks he inaudible  and then four is four four is one  yeah yeah were done  im getting there were at ten now  nine nine no were in nine why did you get the what why would you ask that its because its a index two six is a index one so a index ofright yeah six is at the question nine yeah lets say our main method looks like this all right choose the correct puzzles for each step why what is is our midvariable equals what is going on whats ten like ten be likeno no no there just asking for like wheres six why would our mid value and whatever wheres theokay our key of six is smaller than its fine  right to its face  he didnt mean to   is apologizing  when we get close and talk to each other they go like boomerang over okay  i need some more chris listen ten can we can give ten a break we used a binary for question  we can skip this for a second  no no no listen assuming an array is already sorted which search method is more efficient for finding and element than an array for finding its linear or binary binary okay  this one  searches you cant use binary crosstalk  right but assuming its already sorted so if its not sorted then we would go binary  right  huh why my dick oh the mic i forgot   he meant to say his dinner  his dithere we go yeah i need to clean my bag all right this was from back when i studied okay so so repeatedly select the largest number and then swaps it with the first yeah the first number and then it keeps going but i dont know why they dont say that  what the smallest my bad i just read the question again its smallest to the first  eight eight four the page  page eight eight four damn what a jump so ill go with  because this is a bit messed up  nine no i dont use adobe because they keep popping up this message thats like yo buy it buy it now buy it now you know that right  adobe has this like its not an official they dont say official but its expired and i need to renew it so they wont let me use adobe or they do but then they keep popping up a message  then you guys paid for it  it should but i dont know they keep oh my god what if its like a virus you never paid for it  no but i googled it and they did say something about like if you you need to pay or something oh its google whats it called eight eight five eight eight oh there we go so whats the question  wait what about   my bad  a bubble or a blank  im not going to trust it being eight eight four im going to go back a bit  oh look  point seven  yeah  point  point six my god its so far behind okay  i think im here all right here bubble sort it makes sense  the bubble sorts there its not it though its not it trust me  it is but thats not the bubble sort algorithmno oh did you hear her over there crosstalk   largest what were the two options yeah im at two point six now i dont think its word for word we have to actually like look through this  but theres not a single like multiple or a single or singular hey whatd you guys get for the singular or multiple for the bubble the bubble sort thing i think its  whered you find it in the book multiple no thats no its not okay thank you here im literally at it by the oh my god we were reading the black text and theres like should have been the its right there yeah because you dont read the table most of the time okay figure out  point three and make sure you understand thedo we have to watch this video were answering this question were answering this question inaudible  its the bubble sort its just the bubble sort no matter look at question  is the bubble sort another whatcrosstalk  why cant i this says nothingcrosstalk  well crosstalk  huh okay one second very very fair deal no no no we skipped that too  hands over theno im good im good im good im good  oh but they should have swapped two  one and now its one and zero it worked so its one and crosstalk  nick knows groupme oh yeah  chill mom  thank you sweetheart merci okay actually really fair deal we have to like dave david  feels so sketch  so these two we dont know ten four and five  ten and then four and five they didnt show crosstalk  on the where are they  whats four and five no they dont show  you just walk into class asking the tas questions you actually go like to the inaudible   four and five five  so how do you solve them though  its linear search okay okay this is davids report look lookinaudible  thats the goal thats the ultimate im buying handcuffs just like running up to you now youre mine im a troll look they only way you get around is going though me its the ultimate fetish  i mean sandwich not yeah whats it called whats  oh thats touch all right whats   okay so this so instead of these being variables this would be one andcrosstalk  whatsno first my leg is cramping up for no reason ouch yo  i knew you were going to ask thats why i was prepared multiple inaudible   whats  its sort of intriguing instead of not knowing the question whats  crosstalk  we should we should whats  not you like this microphone im just kidding no whats   did we take it though or is it in the book this thing crosstalk  yesterday dude i showed up in class in the beginning she didnt talk about it  okay so theres  and  left what happened yeah i was just kidding  yes thats what i was giving him too trash this is trash  its trash david can agree its trash lets chat trash right yeah  yeah whats   us  i wouldnt give it to you  so this one we deserve a hundred on this because of this typo we deserve the full credit  its okay you will get them later whatsyou mean like its closer more convenient where are you okay ill give you a second page   its red bull five likes and ill do it two screen shots and ill do it  want to get headphones and then we can hear it  yeah just hearing that at the same literally david question whats  just give me the answer no im just kidding i dont get it  okay  and then it stops at two though  theres like three it stops at two i mean theres four see its like one two what this so i just go by does this become wait does this become two well why it replaces with this  does it print out the same thing  so it swaps  oh and then you do this over here again just like three two well no what the frick five what crosstalk  yup yup  its going to be a thats why i noticed look at this in three twocrosstalk  were supposed to put the smallest numbers here oh okay and then a two you kind of keepwhy is it not two in the beginning wouldnt it make mores sense  all right so thats two thats three and then five and then two three five eight  fucking i mean frick it dude we should get a fact check before  does this look right  honestly ill step on two  thanks  no no no its three ill tell you and tab okay ill give you the number and you tab okay  do you have a  okay so three then two five five and then tab five tab click five tab eight tab  he told me it was correct so i dont know crosstalk  no show me if you have it though  can i just take this so yeah its three twoim right im right  its not saudi arabia its lebanon i just inaudible  no when did i say that crosstalk  no crosstalk  i have it on my key chain i walk everywhere i say im lebanese im from lebanon lesbian i mean lets i meant i cant write anything inaudible  now we only have like  left right  yeah what rhymes withno im lesbian im lebanese im trying to cover up the other word so what do we do here crosstalk  huh this one do you have  from ive checked i meanwait this cant be touched im just kidding i would never promise i will stop touching this if you never jump in elevators  wait theyre explaining theyre explaining crosstalk  dont move it  its also not going to do anything  oh its like the thing they did in class six replaces so its nine sevencrosstalk   two threethe second one doesnt change third one just switches the seven with the six actually noits just two three five six and then two three five six seven eight nine and then just replace it again two three five six seven eight nine wait what are you doing im going to sneak im getting in closer wait  okay three is two three five six seven nine eight and then two three five six seven eight nine and the same thing four and five repeat right  oops yikes im just kidding crosstalk  what did i do  oh melanie you guyswait can i see  then can i know the wrong answer its having usokay after this i close mine crosstalk  yes its a deal right  listen and after this i end minecrosstalk  low key yes hes very accurate with that but listen i close mine and you redo yours and ill try another output  right makes sense crosstalk  why wont you give me it crosstalk  so how much did you get  why is it not one crosstalk  whats your eight whats your eight question eight question eight crosstalk   huh crosstalk  why crosstalk  why though okay so if youre redoing it its minus one crosstalk  its minus one why is it minus one whod you get it from  huh yeah are you done crosstalk  wait what crosstalk    okay we didnt laugh at that morgan did you figure something out are you hiding something from us all right weve got that thing on right okay theyll get annoyed if we open this but then how do we have this just hanging like this i know inaudible  the ta has his own ta six youre an asshole look at this dude are you in this one someone must have a nerf war in here yeah im chill did that come from my bag give me my bag yo theyre going to make me pay for this mic yo fuck inaudible  just dont do it morgan morgan five dollars and ill do it just kidding man brother i have the book show me activity i cant open two pdfs at the same time making an array inaudible  two a we dont have to get two random numbers right but where do we use the two random numbers huh from  to  oh so from  to  and then  to  yo pants are falling down my card key open queue huh fill the array with random integer numbers between  to  so i just put this in that a random number between like inaudible  inside the thing  to  inside the thing no i just heard you say that okay okay okay my question wasnt answered is it inside the okay screw it i dont yeah i know lets finish the first two parts first yo yo my pants are falling was it max minus min minus min plus one was it max minus min minus min plus one mia minus one minus two minus one  and  close it up all of it okay does that work should i close it okay oh okay okay okay why cant we convert into array to int oh does it work i did should i do it from outside show me how you do it got you so we dont put it inside of it i know oh dude did it work can you show me again does this work no it rounds it down yeah plus  he has it over there i cant open two a range between  and  should i call it its  okay mmhmm affirmative by  so plus  but  and   inclusive right thats  now  like  and  basically  im lost okay yeah i think so i can copy it from one of my old code mmhmm affirmative thats when we used to do  we used to put random number yeah yep you get  which is  so its  then minus  is  i mean  yeah one question isnt this inside  its  and then this is minus  so you tart from  and then you add  so you dont end up with  do you yeah it became  in total  mmhmm affirmative but when you add  now its  and  yeah  and  oh and then we dont include  okay got you got you got you thank you so much i need to raise my pants this is too much im nearly trapped by this cord all right hold this for a sec finally did you figure out anything my codes not working both of them yeah im stuck at mathrandom what have i come to no look i have errors okay never mind never mind these are my own you all are on to arrays right now what did you do david look at this and understand where its gone wrong i havent started anything yet like look where okay whoops equals to do i say int thats what i was going to do do i say int or not here this is the random number between  and  right right what do i do with it thats all you guys asked for really on the question oh okay crosstalk  you have it wait yo what have you been doing is that all which method hes like one of those digimon digimon he called it scuffed pokemon its a god damn disgrace inaudible  yeah but still theres this spot in your heart for the evolutions of where did you get this from what this goes through both the columns wheres your random number oh you called one row you called one oh okay okay thats nice okay whats the first one called it goes to  row less than there you go wow im really crosstalk  with the row what was the okay and then row plus plus oh okay with the inaudible  credit to brandon did you do intro okay its giving me an error should i have set it outside main arraylength now it went what the frick i have no idea whats going on inaudible  well i got them both wrong though what did you initialize yours as i tried to do that and david told me its wrong there hold on equals to boom it actually worked what is going on poo poo pee pee okay and then what did you do with the cool so both of them are random numbers between  and  the row and the column oh theyre both the same like in the same rows and same columns no as in size of the thing true how is it swimming if this is an empty array you realize i do hold on a minute my hands are starting to hurt did you try running it true i need a drill hit i need to stay awake yo you need to come out with me or you can hold this for a sec for the row and column lets say right but can it be like  okay so do them separately lets see if that works kill me uh oh uh oh all of a sudden if you separate it it gives you a mistake an error dont try to do that the row and column yo im passing out in the light rail  percent if she separates it its not going to work though thats what you did what page of the book are you looking at dude im gonna pass out all right peace guys im fainting any second if i go back to the light rail im fucked listen listen if this is due some other time huh inaudible  its in  minutes or more my brain do you understand do you understand inaudible  do you know that it looks like its running no it gave an error look see right now we put a or like the whole thing yeah i think we should make a method inaudible  huh ill take a picture listen for part c you have to calculate the average right yeah align it or take a picture because im not going to take it from here and then how would you print it lights glaring column inaudible  column in the array okay oh ill explain later any updates yo whats up dude i cant no no this time it was homework no no really homework like i had like two games of league that night thats it thats nothing two no that day it was actually two i know but thats only two games usually i play eight even more yeah ish minutes plus a few it depends if im playing inaudible  im going to go for like ten easy yeah thats what i usually play like earth is literally ten minutes im not the only person so many people all right boy really all right some people have left lets leave it im going to click on this all right dude mmhmm affirmative should i click it fourteen fourteen actually what does he have oh consumption the plague yeah did they kill you by feeding you certain seeds like in the s this is how you print it up but i dont know what do i put outside the loop no no conspiracy theory step one brandon get closer crosstalk  no but seriously get closer did we send the illuminati over here with the circle so we can help each other out morgan spill the tea where were you at we have the circle going on like get closer like lets open its lets leave no ill show you look wait im going to see if it prints out though bunch of bologna i knew it doesnt work one second im not going to give you something that doesnt work see it doesnt work it actually does one second i fucking knew it look look look look look look see god dammit dont prove me how wait you knew seriously so thats another four loop right okay what page was that merci okay so yeah okay that kind of makes sense you two crosstalk  speaking of crosstalk  you have to use an enter to go through each line right what if you put the make another loop click to loop thats a new way,checking  work  yeah  open  open  keep  uh  putting  pressure  oh  locked  dont  know  would  open  yeah  doesnt  open  yeah  youre  going  hold  drop  mic  drop  mic  cause  every  time  finish  line  code  drop  im  kidding  stop  take  seriously  guy  interested  try  figure  probably  locked  something  thats  noticed  put  sec  okay  look  mine  open  scream  scare  open  thats  microphone  broken  doesnt  clip  open  one  deal  hold  look  like  badass  tv  host  doesnt  give  fuck  mic  dangling  ah  gon  na  fall  going  yeah  wonder  nice  wire  hurt  confusion  hold  okay  ill  put  pocket  okay  telling  enter  string  thats  output  thats  parallelogram  asking  enter  string  okay  parallelogram  get  string  almost  process  think  input  input  would  belets  research  im  pretty  sure  first  one  youre  asking  something  youre  outputting  message  system  go  always  index  index  dont  think  ofif  exists  put  counter  one  probably  one  let  work  two  together  finished  number  one  think  listen  flow  chart  code  andbut  code  right  ill  show  thats  bullshit  though  im  kidding  really  doesnt  make  sense  use  name  something  keep  giving  compiler  error  four  think  want  put  five  put  five  four  bullshit  dude  im  failing  feel  oh  god  man  zero  four  le  five  local  variable  lineand  dude  signature  signature  trust  im  kidding  actually  gon  na  im  kidding  sound  like  sound  like  there  one  yeah  probably  six  watch  another  option  didnt  see  im  parched  im  thirsty  im  gon  na  get  water  wow  going  even  joking  say  probably  going  eight  fucking  five  yes  actually  youre  right  there  small  select  think  got  three  yeah  much  get  theshit  like  know  method  thought  method  like  thing  goesyeah  yeah  probably  eight  like  okay  want  copy  send  oh  phone  okay  swear  swear  almost  like  youyou  know  certain  prison  theythey  whats

yeah march  okay and you are team  or group  yeah perfect thank you okay id just like to inaudible  you the program inaudible  what did you say where yeah i mean thats like if statements and stuff conditional okay first get the scanner um enter wait is this one small inaudible  did you do that as a string i mean are you doing it as a string for like inaudible  thats this one yeah you have it like do it like touching which one do you you put it in you have to um inaudible  yes base and then well you keep the ln like on that statement so you dont want it there so like space from that and then put the ln well then you can have that out well just run it and make sure nope it usually has to have it like touching the other one okay oh i can see so did you do are you doing okay okay so im guessing you wouldnt have to use methods for this im assuming so not just ifn saying crosstalk  three of the circles are here yeah pi r squared we should do let me pull up the book like how the book use the if statement to decide which method to use so like if mmhmm affirmative well if it was square its just a side so it would equal the same thing well just say into the length of side of one side or something should we leave it as that and not the are we making a whole nother method oh i didnt see i thought you were just putting them as when oh no you just is it not elseif or does it matter okay mmhmm affirmative where did you have it print inaudible  wait will you say like rectangle length width is going to be returning two different things okay so when you call it crosstalk  but if its printing this out isnt it printing out the answer and then its going to return length and width okay um oh yeah thats right you and the first one what do you mean like this i did it like does this work or did i do it define area here that one made this one not red anymore well mine was like that first and then i finish yeah i finished mine yeah so i just did the public static and square under it and len and then i defined area like that i think thats how it works and then i do the same thing for i did the same thing for the rectangle and then um like what do you mean i didnt do that though hm yeah okay entit ent base i can define the area in each of them right okay yeah okay yeah yeah yeah half done i think thats right is there a do i just hit the inaudible  for mine or is there like okay ah defined everything you cant do the power because everythings in ent and everythings doubles yeah so you just have to do pi then you do r times inaudible  hm  is inaudible  doubled crosstalk  its mathpow yeah it is but it says that it cant do it because ent inaudible  yeah i dont know why this is like this i did i keep getting wait where do you get x and y they correlate to the oh so i was supposed to put oh okay okay but it keeps saying i its like underlined and its not something for this unit it says pi n is undefined for the type develop math i dont know what that means it says create a method pi but i dont wanna do that i thought maybe declaring it or something like that cannot convert from double to in im not asking you to convert oh because this will  give you a decimal because this is  so do we need to just make this one oh there we go okay i got it your triangle is broken how did you do it i just did i did i just didnt want to whatever whatever yeah i was going to say because that because crosstalk  because  divided by  its oh i got  now when i let me see without the parentheses i dont know what its supposed to be like let me see um okay i got it its you dont have the parentheses around the  i looked it up just to make sure because i dont know how to do it oh so you did the double area area divided by  oh okay i can look it up okaythere was a second problem without the program running like which checks whether integers even or odd okay enter a integer yeah this is like a whole different yeah is this the one i think it is inaudible  inaudible  a string because im pretty sure i saw that yeah okay if num um okay i did um what do i okay i think i got it okay what did you do did it inaudible  theok it runsoh i didnt do the closing statements i just did ifls and return oh and you did it like i  yeah its working today yeah mmhmm affirmative march th i feel like were almost done so oh we have to do flow charts oh  did we even push start okay is this notoop this answer  is saying um inever on this one it was saying that i wasnt in the right like i have to change mywas yours an ent or a string my thing is right oh yeah yeah now its working okay uh what is it prompt the user like this is that student code right okay yeah sign input to word um create met with method to get valid oh no theres one right there in front of you yeah hey they dont want you to put the code in the student code right okay okay so do it okay got it do i have to do it for each one or can i get like where aeiou i can just write mmhmm affirmative mmhmm affirmative thank you okay how do we do methods in flow charts okay i have first enter the string then put it into word can i just put word there or  do i have to do more well like does this rectangles are like for processes happening so im just putting like  input the secret just word we cant use what do you mean we cant use that string what what um what it doesnt say that on the back maybe she didnt mean to say that i dont think im doing this right actually but i think these are the inaudible  statements what did you say yeah hm ha okay this is what i got i dont know how right it is you need me to mmhmm affirmative yeah today is april nd okay yeah it copies the references crosstalk  copies the reference i just looked in the book and it says that is a reference in which we use i think this one is the first one or make a copy of the past array i think thats what its saying is in the second program too question  hm okay activity  begin an array thats inaudible  user um yes yeah okay sorry you know what else it no string  not  its the same its the same ten names because its with the zeta okay what is that i didnt thats right names i equals inputnext okay um ah okay because that does that code basically was there why does it matter its black just because its not all the way done yet wait index is a number arent you returning wait what is it asking you return oh yeah nevermind you wouldnt need it nevermind i think youre returning the i not the index what is the point of having the index equal zero no im saying like why do you have to have that and then make this equal that couldnt you just return i and not set that to zero or set it to i no just uh i guess thats here i had it written like that i think if i got that oh why oh why it got mixed up okay okay it works yeah i need to shut the sorry yes this transcript was exported on apr    view latest version here,yeah  march  okay  team  group  yeah  perfect  thank  okay  id  like  program  say  yeah  mean  thats  like  statement  stuff  conditional  okay  first  get  scanner  um  enter  wait  one  small  string  mean  string  like  thats  one  yeah  like  like  touching  one  put  um  yes  base  well  keep  ln  like  statement  dont  want  like  space  put  ln  well  well  run  make  sure  nope  usually  like  touching  one  okay  oh  see  okay  okay  im  guessing  wouldnt  use  method  im  assuming  ifn  saying  three  circle  yeah  pi  r  squared  let  pull  book  like  book  use  statement  decide  method  use  like  mmhmm  affirmative  well  square  side  would  equal  thing  well  say  length  side  one  side  something  leave  making  whole  nother  method  oh  didnt  see  thought  putting  oh  elseif  matter  okay  mmhmm  affirmative  print  wait  say  like  rectangle  length  width  going  returning  two  different  thing  okay  call  printing  isnt  printing  answer  going  return  length  width  okay  um  oh  yeah  thats  right  first  one  mean  like  like  work  define  area  one  made  one  red  anymore  well  mine  like  first  finish  yeah  finished  mine  yeah  public  static  square  len  defined  area  like  think  thats  work  thing  thing  rectangle  um  like  mean  didnt  though  hm  yeah  okay  entit  ent  base  define  area  right  okay  yeah  okay  yeah  yeah  yeah  half  done  think  thats  right  hit  mine  like  okay  ah  defined  everything  cant  power  everythings  ent  everythings  double  yeah  pi  r  time  hm  doubled  mathpow  yeah  say  cant  ent  yeah  dont  know  like  keep  getting  wait  get  x  correlate  oh  supposed  put  oh  okay  okay  keep  saying  like  underlined  something  unit  say  pi  n  undefined  type  develop  math  dont  know  mean  say  create  method  pi  dont  wan  na  thought  maybe  declaring  something  like  convert  double  im  asking  convert  oh  give  decimal  need  make  one  oh  go  okay  got  triangle  broken  didnt  want  whatever  whatever  yeah  going  say  divided  oh  got  let  see  without  parenthesis  dont  know  supposed  like  let  see  um  okay  got  dont  parenthesis  around  looked  make  sure  dont  know  oh  double  area  area  divided  oh  okay  look  okaythere  second  problem  without  program  running  like  check  whether  integer  even  odd  okay  enter  integer  yeah  like  whole  different  yeah  one  think  string  im  pretty  sure  saw  yeah  okay  num  um  okay  um  okay  think  got  okay  theok  runsoh  didnt  closing  statement  ifls  return  oh  like  yeah  working  today  yeah  mmhmm  affirmative  march  th  feel  like  almost  done  oh  flow  chart  oh  even  push  start  okay  notoop  answer  saying  um  inever  one  saying  wasnt  right  like  change  mywas  ent  string  thing  right  oh  yeah  yeah  working  okay  uh

okay it says draw the flow chart but it doesnt say submit the flow chart anywhere so  im just going to not inaudible  shape and its dimensions do you think when it says conditional statements do you think that allows switch statements it says under the to do this you need to the third bullet says in the main method you  will use conditional statement does that include switch statements i hope so yeah i hope that doesnt mean just uh inaudible  this one should be easier aw wait he just said we have to use ifl statements i dont want to use ifelse statementscrosstalk  whats the thing you can do for like whats the thing you can do to do new lines and  backslash and then end do you have to put anything inside of it or do you just leave it oh is it oh oh you put it in the quotes so you just do and then you just keep on yeah i dont know inaudible  is this one supposed to be this way oh that just depends how you want it i guess if you put a space therell be an extra space so it just depends how you want it crosstalk  alright weve gotten that taken care of crosstalk  im just trying to put it make a line so inaudible  im just going to get some water yeah okay ah so im going to need a few integers so ns your radius and with length width base height because we have triangles too i guess im just thinking if i like you knowcrosstalk  so anyways i was just going to do the condition for deciding which method its going to use i was  just going to do that first ill just do the methods after yeah i heard him talking to someone else earlier saying they want us to use ifs so so id just be like if assign me my variable shape if shape is equal to the one then were doing so what does it want us to tell them okay so just the area okay so you can just make it be like system l crosstalk   oh wait so now that its a square youre not going to be like enter the length and width length undo length then width feeling more specific so that one we squared crosstalk  length equals we put dot inaudible   and then width equals inaudible  oh yeah i guess i hear it you can just change it to lengthwidth because you know  theyre the same and then just only take one of the end parts yeah the length yeah yeah whatever semantics it doesnt really matter so after it reads that it should just do im trying to remember how to okay just the  name of it so itll give you an error until you write it but im just going to write it down  because all im going to do is print im just going to make it im going to name the  function square and then its going to be an integer so its going to be square so im  just gooing to leave it as that its going to yell at you for right now because its not there  but im just going to leave it until yeah were going to make a method eventually but its just not there yet i just decided  im going to name the method squares i just put it in as its going to be when i run it oh no no square because it should be a one variable method so so if shade equals equals twoso were just going to be doing the same thing basically over and over for this you can just do ifs if you really want to you could just put one else at the end where its like if its not any of  these then you can put an else that just says like invalid entry or something like we  used to do with switch statements back then see this one makes much more sense as a switch statement but whatever so  is  rectangle yeah enter the so this one actually needs length and width then width of the rectangle so then this one is just rectangle length width width shape equals three oops yeah so now this is the same right here as no see when you call a method right so methods you know they require two certain  points and it gives you certain output but when you have you have to call it you have to  specify what youre using as the inputs and thats what that is you do the name of the  method and then so for example rectangle when we make it will be a two variable  method where it just multiplies them together but it needs you to what you put in the parentheses after it those are the variables it will take when it calls the method yeah but thats just what you draw thats what you want it to print all thats just  where i put like the area is and then that but yeah its going to return the result of the method yeah i think you guys when you write that youre basically writing give me the result if you  were to run that method with these numbers thats like what that means so that is  like shorthand for that whole method using those two numbers inaudible  so anyways done with that almost done with the easy part alright did you finish that part the inaudible  so now we have to do the actually make the methods now which is the harder part alright so im trying to remember the syntax for those little parts okay public static okay yes so well start with public static so we have the in the thing right before the mean that  is the output type yes output type doubled yes so many integers so lets start with  a square then you so thats your i cant use length again can i no you cant okay whats the problem here friend syntax error yeah in the square it doesnt like that im not sure why crosstalk  no public static yeah hold on mine doesnt like that though here im going to bring up the text book  it doesnt like something public static name why dont you like that alright lets try this instead okay this hm public static ent yeah so whats wrong with this who i worry is it  just because i havent written anything is that like if i just do like hm move your val model from full model for parameter squared is it just like the name really… hm see okay i dont know mine yeah no im just theres something wrong with mine where it just doesnt like any of this did you actually finish it no hurry alright ill try that first and see if that lets it in okay yeah so and area equals so the return area hey i know what it is i fixed it i failed to close the other method you have to close your if youre going to do another method you have use another  semicolon to close the original method oh look and i just take out the semicolon  thats closing the other one thats why its yelling at me again i put it back its gone its  because this is a part of the this public static void method and it was you have to close it you must have you must have put an extra semicolon somewhere and thats making it work because that was making mine not work i dont know how you would have got around that oh i didnt put that back okay so now all you have to do is just go yeah within each method you can reuse yeah it wouldnt matter anyways because it only uses one every time the program runs yeah rectangle entx ent triangle entwhoops entx entent area equals x times y times  divided by two one half base times height return area thats probably good enough i dont know ent oops entarea oh yeah pi r its pi r squared right pi r squared so i would just do  times times radius where is radius highlighted in red thats weird oh wait because nevermind im inaudible  i know exactly why its highlighted when you do power as in power is math capitalized mathpow and then oh really pi r squared pi r squared pi oh oops i didnt have to do that well we can fix that we just need to change some variables around return area there we go ah too many of these yeah so is this saying its going to tell  me yep okay we can fix that so its just when you do math methods its kind of confusing but these variables those are yeah so like for example i mean you can because when you define them here theyre only defined for the  you can but like i was just trying to do this because i feel like that for like later more  complicated things might be better to just but can you do multiplication like you do in like try instead of putting just try putting a multiplication sign between the pi and that instead of maybe its  getting oh now its getting ive broken all of it area equals pi times yeah oh you need to make area a double you need to make it you need to make it return a double too so change it from public static in to public static double alright im clean on errors now im going to try this so im going to try all of them square  times   alright so lets try a rectangle   and  should be  alright good lets try a triangle alright its  by  zero okay well  my triangle is broken apparently yeah i put in  and  and got zero i did  times base times height you might want to put parentheses about around  divided by  because that can be  an order of operations problem i think it might be because its an integer im going to  try converting this one to a double as well yeah were dividing so uh lets try that   i got  yeah i dont know whats wrong with this it should not be giving us that what happens if i so crosstalk  okay so it must be a problem in our im going to do this the long way because length is  area divided by  alright this should fix it im doing it i did it the easy way yep see there you go i just did that two lines that are on yeah either way those work im not going to calculate im just going to put a number and  see if it sounds right thats probably about right put in  see what you get yep  im  off but i dont care oh its this is easy you should just do another systemout entln so leaving so another oh did it where there oh i thought it meant like take your answer you already got  and check that no its just another one okay thats easier that might be actually kind of hard but no i have no clue enter n enter inaudible ent uh equals input max ent all we have to do  for that is do systementprintln alright so i just need to be sure and make a method  call it even just want to call it mine public static what data types can you all put in a  method can you do like a string can i return a string it can return a stringcrosstalk  well were going to find out returned oh i forgot to put a name on it there we go string cannot be resolved to a type oh string is capitalized okay if x oops so now we just have it reout return and save inaudible  to resolve to a variable excuse me oops alright i just did i just did this huh alright well thats about it for me then guess were about done it runs uh just about yeah yeah we do oh you need to say the numbers  hope that works anyways yeah okay uh no he did anyways um yeah so that works i probably could have been a little more graceful but  i forgot about doing like the part  part  so but whatever i hate doing the long chains of like inaudible cat and substring and stuff but i dont know it works yeah we have to do the flow charts apparently and i think they wanted us to do  i think he only wanted us for the first one not both of them so that saves us a little bit of time i got it you having a problem did you declare in some yeah you did its working now alright im going to do the student code or whatever yep right inaudible  gonna do… yeah but i been want to do for the first one no you did not just die on me piece of garbage im back now i have a charger its a matter of if i can find a place to plug it in oh is it inaudible  i if this is all the way it goes this spring well okay at  minimum you assume it would save because it saves every time it runs so most of all is probably saved in fact all of its probably saved except the student codes no i usually just like well i guess inaudible  tedious description of exactly what it does who wrapped this up so early this is ainaudible  oh no i would just do one and just say that it does it for every one alright barry come back to me please i very much just dont want to do anything hard oh hey it didnt even actually turn off it just went into sleep mode so okay so it meets sorry alright well the rest will sort of go so much neater like this collapse it all up and done anyways how do you do methods in flow charts i dont know thats a good question huh um yeah going be  inaudible  uh i usually just do like string wait is there a reason why i cant just do this what could you possibly do without unless you how could you possibly do that without a substring what the hell no see thats bs it just says you cannot use script that doesnt mean you dont substring okay i have no idea how you can possibly set substring yeah i feel like she didnt it doesnt say that it it says you cant use spark but it substring yeah im just going to leave it there and im just be like the thing says it  ah anyways hows the flow chart look okay so we have yeah cause nobody wants to inaudible  no i said no one wants the first one so um oh yeah this probably isnt very good for writing a flow chart is it um yikes yeah i realize that now unfortunately oh how did it get to  so fast hm inaudible  alright same i mean yeah i mean this is basically it its just its convoluted yeah i mean yeah thats more or less it its just yeah this is so slow alright oh yeah so you can just send me the picture of that you emailed me once before didnt you okay thats sensible we should probably shut this off then shouldnt we alright i need to move to on inaudible  if anything changes on our list from the  so the first one has to do that one yeah because see in that one if anything changes in either list  or list  both will  update in this one and in  if list  changes that wont change list  i dont think oh okay cool inaudible  okay almost done lets take the other method and then a new one inaudible  past how we do this inaudible  make a copy of the past work inaudible  i think its the first one anywayinaudible  sync well that worked define in your way of string the entire inaudible  names read a search method font name search inaudible  array of string data okay that doesnt seem too bad tifat inaudible  okay um it says ten names right entover inaudible  so we can just use a loop so string uh names no i think i think you i think it starts at zero as far as how it counts but that number you put in is  how many slots total you want so i think its still  um string  okay then we need another string so the idea is that you ten names  from the user and then it searches for the name okay so it switches the string inaudible  index of the name okay so now get them to enter the name of the search enter the name of the search oh i need to do the entering the names first forgot all that inaudible  for that i is less than  theni plus this names i inaudible  oops yeah id use just the just next but yeah i figure names are usually one word long but  yeah it doesnt probably matter so then we can just do whoops string name string i dont know key equals mnext  you have to enter the name theyre looking for alright so now we need to make a method so systemoutprintinaudible   name underscore search oh the arguments being names and um names and then  key and i have to declare that down here public static uh that returns a ent uh  name underscore search um string how do you declare methods and have a raise in  them thats like oh ent its what type it is okay so string name string q return  index inaudible  ent indux equals zero hm i know where this inaudible  oh wait hold on this is near the brackets  yeah there we go um okay so now it just needs to do your search or whatever so   enti equals zero i is less than  i  if if uh names i p index oh wait hold on it  needs to return the index oh yeah so index equals i uh the name inaudible  the name is in index of the list uh i mean yeah more or less i think its a little simplified actually well i mean that is  for searching numbers this is for just searching its just comparing every space in the  array to what youre looking for and when it finds it it just tells you what slot it was in  when it found them maybe do you have that returning anything yet it wont work until its returning  something im going to check this real quick joan pearl selfinaudible  uh oh that didnt work hm yeah wants you to tell you where i dont know why this isnt working index zero oh what no its whatever i can just do thiswell if index equals i then its the same thing probably an unnecessary variable but  just because you have to declare it doesnt mean you can just declare things to zero  you dont have a problem with things not working for whatever reason you dont really im going to change it i mean its kind of i just put it there because thats where my train of thought was going at the time i dont know why this isnt working this doesnt make any sense inaudible  okay so now it works    okay well mine works alright thats that one whats wrong with yours is something wrong with it is it just not finding it even if its there let me see it again yeah see okay when i hit mine doing equals equals it wasnt working here try it onlu equals yeah oh yeah okay well you can do what i did i changed it from equals equals to contains key and for some reason that works equals equals inaudible  yeah that  works for me when equals equals didnt i dont know why i want to take yeah just putting in single letters that looks the best alright well there you go alrightinaudible  already i guess we should they  told us to raise our hand to get the things taken off alright oh dang we got some pokemon here ah youre good were finished yeah yes,okay  say  draw  flow  chart  doesnt  say  submit  flow  chart  anywhere  im  going  shape  dimension  think  say  conditional  statement  think  allows  switch  statement  say  need  third  bullet  say  main  method  use  conditional  statement  include  switch  statement  hope  yeah  hope  doesnt  mean  uh  one  easier  aw  wait  said  use  ifl  statement  dont  want  use  ifelse  statementscrosstalk  whats  thing  like  whats  thing  new  line  backslash  end  put  anything  inside  leave  oh  oh  oh  put  quote  keep  yeah  dont  know  one  supposed  way  oh  depends  want  guess  put  space  therell  extra  space  depends  want  alright  weve  gotten  taken  care  im  trying  put  make  line  im  going  get  water  yeah  okay  ah  im  going  need  integer  n  radius  length  width  base  height  triangle  guess  im  thinking  like  knowcrosstalk  anyways  going  condition  deciding  method  going  use  going  first  ill  method  yeah  heard  talking  someone  else  earlier  saying  want  u  use  ifs  id  like  assign  variable  shape  shape  equal  one  want  u  tell  okay  area  okay  make  like  system  l  oh  wait  square  youre  going  like  enter  length  width  length  undo  length  width  feeling  specific  one  squared  length  equal  put  dot  width  equal  oh  yeah  guess  hear  change  lengthwidth  know  theyre  take  one  end  part  yeah  length  yeah  yeah  whatever  semantics  doesnt  really  matter  read  im  trying  remember  okay  name  itll  give  error  write  im  going  write  im  going  print  im  going  make  im  going  name  function  square  going  integer  going  square  im  gooing  leave  going  yell  right  im  going  leave  yeah  going  make  method  eventually  yet  decided  im  going  name  method  square  put  going  run  oh  square  one  variable  method  shade  equal  equal  twoso  going  thing  basically  ifs  really  want  could  put  one  else  end  like  put  else  say  like  invalid  entry  something  like  used  switch  statement  back  see  one  make  much  sense  switch  statement  whatever  rectangle  yeah  enter  one  actually  need  length  width  width  rectangle  one  rectangle  length  width  width  shape  equal  three  oops  yeah  right  see  call  method  right  method  know  require  two  certain  point  give  certain  output  call  specify  youre  using  input  thats  name  method  example  rectangle  make  two  variable  method  multiplies  together  need  put  parenthesis  variable  take  call  method  yeah  thats  draw  thats  want  print  thats  put  like  area  yeah  going  return  result  method  yeah  think  guy  write  youre  basically  writing  give  result  run  method  number  thats  like  mean  like  shorthand  whole  method  using  two  number  anyways  done  almost  done  easy  part  alright  finish  part  actually  make  method  harder  part  alright  im  trying  remember  syntax  little  part  okay  public  static  okay  yes  well  start  public  static  thing  right  mean  output  type  yes  output  type  doubled  yes  many  integer  let  start  square  thats  cant  use  length  cant  okay  whats  problem  friend  syntax  error  yeah  square  doesnt  like  im  sure  public  static  yeah  hold  mine  doesnt  like  though  im  going  bring  text  book  doesnt  like  something  public  static  name  dont  like  alright  let  try  instead  okay  hm  public  static  ent  yeah  whats  wrong  worry  havent  written  anything  like  like  hm  move  val  model  full  model  parameter  squared  like  name  hm  see  okay  dont  know  mine  yeah  im  there  something  wrong  mine  doesnt  like  actually  finish  hurry  alright  ill  try  first  see  let  okay  yeah  area  equal  return  area  hey  know  fixed  failed

plus people oh there it is crosstalk  like to invoke a method crosstalk  to  crosstalk  it says it on the right crosstalk  yes and no we want you to crosstalk  so it would be what it would be crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  wait so we can put crosstalk  im still trying to figure it out crosstalk  so if you have this crosstalk  im popping it right there but it still is not right like this crosstalk  trouble thats why i have all my methods and some people might have a better way okay so i dont know crosstalk  because it says here it has to be crosstalk  ah bugger crosstalk  i feel like theres a lot of ways to get crosstalk  so here crosstalk  yeah it was a little bit too short so youre just utilizing what youre getting down here crosstalk  same way with crosstalk  no i so we were texting him but yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so im just worried about the crosstalk  im just saying  because i read through it yeah because that would be what they input crosstalk  im still getting an error oh its in a main crosstalk  so im working on the first one and the assignment says to use comparative to make the selection based off a text input so i go write in square circle et cetera et cetera from there how do i get it to go into the public class into the method that i crosstalk  these are cumbersome thatd be a tangled mess crosstalk  okay so where its got here max inaudible  into  thats literally what the what its called its not running a maximum inaudible  so i could call it whatever i want as long as crosstalk  oh okay and and for comparing strings  oh its dot equals for crosstalk  oh dot equals i just put that to see crosstalk  choice  dot equals  crosstalk  so i chose choice as the input parentheses square crosstalk  so no quotation so choice oh okay crosstalk  so wait that means just delete this one right here crosstalk  i was just trying to do the string thing but chris crosstalk  yeah now im not sure crosstalk  okay so now just while im running this i ask for the input for base and height i call them base and height because ive already declared it here i dont need to declare them up here all right so that declares it inherently since im not passing anything down all right so down here ill have system data out print input base and height and then just calculation and then return area all right so i can just have public inaudible  in square empty and then declare them in here so delete them here delete them here and then declare them in the second method because i have set them okay i was just looking here and its like oh that looks like that okay yeah its like bare bones crosstalk  so if its an older system crosstalk  oh yeah do you know if we can write all on one code crosstalk  which segment are you stuck on yeah i thought you were working on two i finished with the square im working on the rectangle now but ive got the process down now so those should go pretty quickly crosstalk  lets see whats the second one crosstalk  all right the second one looks relatively easy problem  you want to go and start on that while i finish problem one why is it numbered one and  crosstalk  so it turns out that there is a crosstalk  can you just send that email because when you sent it i think gmail was down then it crosstalk  can i borrow you for a second crosstalk  and if its one its r oh right now yeah oh i didnt know im sorry crosstalk  yeah that day the email wasnt working it didnt crosstalk  whats your name okay crosstalk  oh yeah studdard  submitted a time crosstalk  we dont have to do the fourth one right we dont or we do yeah this works crosstalk  hm i cant see your screen crosstalk  yeah im done im just testing it try adding a return to each so add  like here see i have it returning like that a return to each if statement in the second string see i have a return for square area a return for rectangle area crosstalk  that is  crosstalk  i am going to go swimming crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  i just finished the third im about to get out right now crosstalk  yeah so crosstalk  method one two passing it a number and youre returning an integer so youre passing it this oh yeah so if inaudible  two is equal to zero then its even thats right but what are you returning you need to return  you can return a string here which is what i did if you do public static string you can return a string and then you can just return the string even or the string odd essentially youre not printing out in here youre returning  what would print up here oh if youre printing it here then you can just do  you can just make this a void and then  crosstalk  i think and then here  oh your if statement whats the error that its giving you crosstalk  what is the error code crosstalk  oh you defined your new function in your main function oh i did that too i realize it thats why so copy  click this really quick so copy from here to there crosstalk  and then control x here where you can cut it so control x  so now click that bracket and then yeah this is your main function so now paste so now try to run it and it should work hopefully crosstalk  okay click cancel okay so crosstalk  the errors crosstalk  sorry do i use inaudible  for method crosstalk  i have no idea i dont think she ever talked about that did she no you could probably go  branch off i guess but i have no idea crosstalk  is that good okay crosstalk  you want to do the flow chart yeah im going to do mine tomorrow crosstalk  and theyre due tomorrow at midnight you have a nice day not the exit form the assignment crosstalk  okay i thought you said exit form crosstalk  did you finish crosstalk  all right first one is sent to you all right and assignment is submitted crosstalk  just make sure you got the  my half of the program before you go crosstalk  yep looks like you got it  foreign language  no youre good this is why i think we need more slack this is a mess who wrapped this when they said a recorder i had assumed they meant put something on a table not clip it to us so youve already got the first one done do you want to do the flowchart for it while i start working on the second one all right youve already got the drawio oh for petes sake this damn thing this thing is getting more in the way that anything else there you go  oh thatll work wait thats not the question it showed thats not the question it just asked thats not the question it just asked the one it just showed was asking about can a name be displayed somewhere specific the question that was on here was just different from the one that just popped up there i was close with inaudible  i aint got two seconds  oh ive never seen that error before so i dont really know try taking out the underscore between count and vowel i know some symbols can kind of mess it up sometimes and then changing it up there as well nope that wasnt it oh  all right got it working see im just going to go through and add some code or some comments and it should be good to go all right im not sure if it wanted us to do a flowchart for the second one it didnt say it did  its not asking for a flowchart for the second one so im going to assume it doesnt want one i just need to go through and add the pseudo code  all right  bye have a good time well that was dramatic  yeah just going through adding the pseudo code  drawio its an extension of google docs yeah thats it  i mean if you need a hand let me know all right i sent my section of the java file back to you what are you working on do we need to submit the flow chart as part of the grade or is it okay i assumed  lets see  later oh its on your google docs but you need to make a revision to it before you do the way you did it was using a for loop so since youre using a for loop to essentially do it multiple times you have to indicate that by break this into two sections so when youre running the loop and have  here instead so have the input have a and have count showing theyre incrementing and then have a loop back up until its true so itll be easier if i draw it essentially youre treating that a decision maker so you draw it as a parallelogram  so do you see kind of what im poorly explaining so its the for loop then the main component of it then showing your i cannot speak for the life of me youre incrementing a and count and then its looping back until this condition is met and once that condition is met you carry on from there so you have to show that its looping back click over here and drag an arrow on not that one the one sided arrow the one to the right  so you have to have an arrow going from there back up to there until the condition is met good enough itll be in your google drive open your google drive and itll be there it should be go back to the drawio file and there should be one thats either save or download save as and the google drive and there it is all right just submit the work fill out the exit form and we should be good to go all right anything else you need before i go thank you  i dont know what number im on okay im not sure what theyre expecting to get out of a pretty much silent quiz oh crud oh crap no youre all right this is just a terrible system for doing this here do you want to put it on your desk instead i move a lot less no because i dont have the textbook section for  because i dont have up to that page no i dont have for section  because this is only most of the book mine stops at page  or  so i dont have that so i was just going to work from the end and try to figure it out i was just checking this one out alright the only one ive got left is  alright i should be done number  yes wait i think i did it right hang on never mind i did wrong but i know how to do it right its using the bubble sort so its essentially checking at each array whether or not the adjacent numbers are greater than or equal to each other and swapping them if theyre not oh wait no i was right the first time what okay neither do i im assuming its selection sort because thats the only one we havent looked at yet i got this one wrong oh i got two of them wrong or one of them wrong actually are you serious yes i know alright yeah thats what i got as well you mean the last one honestly i have no idea how a section search works i dont have my book with me to check well it says itll be on page  something actually youre right it didnt give you a spot for that one thats weird number  yes the last one bubble should be yes and i think  is selection but im not  sure on that one im just guessing based upon the fact that its different from the three that weve seen so far and ive got an answer for  so im going to try that oh i dont think that was right okay so i got eight and nine wrong and i got  wrong its going to be compiler error why im not sure yes its a compiler error im not sure which one nine is because its not index one eight and nine not sure why though sorry oh i was looking at the i already submitted but for question eight i know its a compiler error but what part of that makes it a compiler error then the brackets and then numbers i thought the textbook said that was also okay just not preferable yes it said the same thing you did you should declare the type with the int and the brackets but it also said the other way was acceptable but not preferable yes its in here somewhere i remember it was right at the beginning allowed but not preferred yes it would be integer well by process of elimination it has to be because question nine which i also got wrong the other three say it has to be an error so by process of elimination that means eight has to be compiler error yes that one was question number eight yes eight and nine completely im not sure would have been possible for me to have gotten it more wrong it didnt tell me which part of its wrong though but that answer is wrong oh okay i see the issue yes thatd be it well i know what i did wrong on eight and nine yes the other one i got wrong is  i think you got  right you got  right i know you did i think you got  right yes oh man huh i mean if you wan to no i would go back but you got a  out of  i like that okay yes  is crosstalk  yes i realize that now and then it searches the wrong half that it doesnt exist then so it returns negative one because it doesnt find it i figured that out about  seconds ago i scrolled back down and i was like oh binary search oh i was thinking of it like a linear search three two five one return of eight two three five eight alright i am through it the second time the only one i dont have right is number  didnt you say you just got that one oh and i went back and fixed the earlier question for eight and nine  this is printing a bunch of zeros let me see your randomizer under the generate numbers youre not generating the numbers for the array right now yoive just got it set to generate the dimensions of the array and then to print the array you dont actually have one set to populate the array thats what this part is here its got the four loop to go through all the rows and then the nest and four loop to go through the columns and each one is generating the number between zero and nine at that spot and then moving on to the next one so you need this bit and its the exact thing thats right here if you want to see it do you want to bother to look for a second to see if you can see it okay what was it to set the minimum value of randomized number again what was it to set the minimum value of a randomized number go back to your code for a second oh two plus yeah yeah oh he is im not im working on summing each column and then finding the average im going to renew it go home then go to column im not sure why its giving you an outofbounds error so take the one out of that randomizer for the plus one sorry and try running it again im just trying to narrow down whatever is different from my coding well its telling you its outofbounds somewhere the thing is i dont know where well youre out of generating numbers earlier theyre just all set to zero so your problem is probably within the section where youre generating the numbers because it was working otherwise before then there we go do you want me to just email this to you so you have one that works all right just run it a bunch of times just makes sure it works reliably run it a bunch of times to make sure it works reliably yeah its working okay yeah all right youre all good ill just make sure to send it to you before i leave class all right all right see you thursday youre all right yup she had to head out early some family thing not really no just   i thought that was due last week  i should probably start working on that youre fine yeah should be yes so for problem  since were working through an array of characters instead of an array of integers is the easiest way to populate it with characters to like assign az a letter each and then convert it or to work from existing or is there a way to just randomize letters in the code itself yeah like generate a random number and they ask you a code range and isnt there something cha or something so itd be draw  id cast cha pretty much well its coming from one way or the other but uh yeah this guys going from character to number but and i should just put that in the factor just to like generate random numbers and convert those numbers just put another loop okay so its an extra loop to convert it from a random number in the range to characters so just converting from the integer of the ascii too ascii too to the characters yeah i just didnt want to go   a   b it would be a little bit time consuming yes right i have internet in front of me what am i doing lets see youre turning average so you have to declare average somewhere you got it right there maybe because its outside that lower bracket im not sure i think its got something to do with where it is like outside that bracket but i run into that all the time so im not really sure   yay wow i actually got that working all right ive got the first part of the second question done ive got it converting from the integers to uh the coordinating string now i just have to search it um for searching the array once ive got them converted to characters instead of integers would it be better to uh save the index of each character and search the im asking that wrong would it be better to search the numerical values of the randomized numbers because ive got them in a separate array because ive got my character array and my main array yeah for some reason i was thinking it was easier to search for an integer than a character yeah i got it yeah  and do i have to do that in a separate method or does it just need to be in a search okay  if it doesnt exist in the array got it got it and i figured out that thing from earlier in order to convert it i literally just had the character array set to the main array but character hooray google  and it has seemed to work  and a quick follow up question to that  for the if this would like to work with me for the ramization  which is here its the minimum value in front and then the distance to the maximum value right um actually no oh there it goes wait a minute i get what youre saying this is working int math at random max minus min plus   plus min its like the rest of my coding janky by somehow functional thats how half of my labs go he just goes im not sure how its working but it is so youre free to go its a good thing im not doing this for a career i took inaudible  computer science   i did like visual basic back in high school but that was like freshman at high school  cool im most of the way through  now im just working on the search bar and then itll be good thank you crosstalk  you have to go okay ah its fine yep tomorrow morning yeah im just working on the search component yeah she had to leave early for something  i have got it printed correctly now the only thing i have left is the comparison which i am working on now to print five times i think the scroll is the same thing well i have got it set with the rows and columns looping like this hang on got to set rows and columns looping five times and nine times printing the major except that row and column closing the first one so closing the column then skipping a line and that will loop and then i just have press enter  end to skip a line after that so i have it printed right below the inaudible  what did you name your  array you just end it arr instead of doing arraylength just put five and nine like i did because i have that working it might not be the directly proper way but it does work it should be but when i changed mine to just the numbers it worked if it does not fix it you can just control z and change it back it is still working the same way there i do not have mine in a separate method so that might be part of it i think  no it would not be there so i will put it there no it is right so in the first two first three first four first five yeah that is right the only thing different is its not a syncing line in between i just need to figure out what it is doing lightly maybe well we have more time than we did before because the test got moved to tuesday well that is next friday i mean i not ready for it either but i am not at the point of panic yet i only panic three days before inaudible  all right inaudible  do you have a quarter do you have a quarter,plus  people  oh  like  invoke  method  say  right  yes  want  would  would  yeah  wait  put  im  still  trying  figure  im  popping  right  still  right  like  trouble  thats  method  people  might  better  way  okay  dont  know  say  ah  bugger  feel  like  there  lot  way  get  yeah  little  bit  short  youre  utilizing  youre  getting  way  texting  yeah  okay  yeah  yeah  yeah  im  worried  im  saying  read  yeah  would  input  im  still  getting  error  oh  main  im  working  first  one  assignment  say  use  comparative  make  selection  based  text  input  go  write  square  circle  et  cetera  et  cetera  get  go  public  class  method  cumbersome  thatd  tangled  mess  okay  got  max  thats  literally  called  running  maximum  could  call  whatever  want  long  oh  okay  comparing  string  oh  dot  equal  oh  dot  equal  put  see  choice  dot  equal  chose  choice  input  parenthesis  square  quotation  choice  oh  okay  wait  mean  delete  one  right  trying  string  thing  chris  yeah  im  sure  okay  im  running  ask  input  base  height  call  base  height  ive  already  declared  dont  need  declare  right  declares  inherently  since  im  passing  anything  right  ill  system  data  print  input  base  height  calculation  return  area  right  public  square  empty  declare  delete  delete  declare  second  method  set  okay  looking  like  oh  look  like  okay  yeah  like  bare  bone  older  system  oh  yeah  know  write  one  code  segment  stuck  yeah  thought  working  two  finished  square  im  working  rectangle  ive  got  process  go  pretty  quickly  let  see  whats  second  one  right  second  one  look  relatively  easy  problem  want  go  start  finish  problem  one  numbered  one  turn  send  email  sent  think  gmail  borrow  second  one  r  oh  right  yeah  oh  didnt  know  im  sorry  yeah  day  email  wasnt  working  didnt  whats  name  okay  oh  yeah  studdard  submitted  time  dont  fourth  one  right  dont  yeah  work  hm  cant  see  screen  yeah  im  done  im  testing  try  adding  return  add  like  see  returning  like  return  statement  second  string  see  return  square  area  return  rectangle  area  going  go  swimming  yeah  finished  third  im  get  right  yeah  method  one  two  passing  number  youre  returning  integer  youre  passing  oh  yeah  two  equal  zero  even  thats  right  returning  need  return  return  string  public  static  string  return  string  return  string  even  string  odd  essentially  youre  printing  youre  returning  would  print  oh  youre  printing  make  void  think  oh  statement  whats  error  giving  error  code  oh  defined  new  function  main  function  oh  realize  thats  copy  click  really  quick  copy  control  x  cut  control  x  click  bracket  yeah  main  function  paste  try  run  work  hopefully  okay  click  cancel  okay  error  sorry  use  method  idea  dont  think  ever  talked  could  probably  go  branch  guess  idea  good  okay  want  flow  chart  yeah  im  going  mine  tomorrow  theyre  due  tomorrow  midnight  nice  day  exit  form  assignment  okay  thought  said  exit  form  finish  right  first  one  sent  right  assignment  submitted  make  sure  got  half  program  go  yep  look  like  got  foreign  language  youre  good  think  need  slack  mess  wrapped  said  recorder  assumed  meant  put  something  table  clip  u  youve  already  got  first  one  done  want  flowchart  start  working  second  one  right  youve  already  got  drawio  oh  petes  sake  damn  thing  thing  getting  way  anything  else  go  oh  thatll  work  wait  thats  question  showed  thats  question  asked  thats  question  asked  one  showed  asking  name  displayed  somewhere  specific  question  different  one  popped  close  aint  got  two  second  oh  ive  never  seen  error  dont  really  know  try  taking  underscore  count  vowel  know  symbol  kind  mess  sometimes  changing  well  nope  wasnt  oh  right  got  working  see  im  going  go  add  code  comment  good  go  right  im  sure  wanted  u  flowchart  second  one  didnt  say  asking  flowchart  second  one  im  going  assume  doesnt  want  one  need  go  add  pseudo  code  right  bye  good  time  well  dramatic  yeah  going  adding  pseudo  code  drawio  extension  google  doc  yeah  thats  mean  need

oh yeah i can imagine must be very difficult anyways yall are good to go have fun so i started with this this is short so if were using the if statement for a string do we use stubble quotations if you use the if statement  to check if the user input this then you  should we do it like this i have no idea what im doing crosstalk  one crosstalk  are you still on one too i was working on one crosstalk  square  okay ill try  crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  the pokemon crosstalk  yeah so the pokemon program is whatever it was crosstalk  i mean actually crosstalk  i dont know why this says this is an error oh crosstalk  are you almost done with one huh return where you did it too im not really familiar with methods yet if you can you can drag and drop because crosstalk  but yes if you cant drag and drop it crosstalk  feel better now okay awesome i think the errors in  crosstalk  yeah flow chart not yet crosstalk  okay crosstalk  yes crosstalk   oh sorry oh  i still have to do the pseudo code and the flow chart  i didnt use a method so i should do that why are you doing it one huh it is what why is there an error input here theres an error input  i dont know why it still gives me an error but she says the name of the method should be this i dont know why i havent started the flowchart yet  i dont know why this gives an error oh i have to do the pseudo code and the flowchart ill send it to you are you done with the second one what do you use to draw flow charts i think its going to take me a while to do the flowchart how do you do your flowcharts so for the flowcharts how do you show methods in this flow charts part one counting vowels oh okay bye how do i send this what how do we do that this i dont know how to send it though what save  sorry i dont have a lot of space on my desk did you do  oh did you do  yes how does it work i dont get it yes the last one for question  i didnt fill it completely well i left the last two blank did you do question   how do you do   hey chris chris did you figure out how to do  yes i cant really find selection sort in my head sort is question  binary yes  is bubble sort  eight is negative  isnt that a  oh negative  nine isnt it negative  did you say you got  wrong oh okay i dont get question  at all sorry did you say this one was wrong i dont know how else to find it alright  out of  i got six wrong what should i just keep it like this would you keep it like this but what was that after the six is that all do you want me to do it again should i do it again and i also question  wrong its  we still have one more attempt right are you going to do it again or not yes  mine just prints zero yeah here no i have it here what what are you done mine is still not printing i dont know why i have an error i need to leave in  minutes and i havent got this done oh okay now its working huh i think i need to do the exit form right now i have to try it again at home do you have my email thanks i think i have to leave now bye  oh sorry do you think this is okay i entered the number rows and columns and values     and it gives this um it says that this cannot be resolved with this variable um i have a question there it says this is between the result of the type and  pressing return av and it ends right here cast  to the print av to oh so like press return result of crosstalk   thank you okay im done with  problem  um for problem   i sent it to you uh maybe not today hi yeah could you email me like crosstalk  part  im sorry i couldnt stay see you tomorrow are you almost done with  you have my email address right  how far did you get i have no idea what i am doing how do you get it to print five times where should i put the loop isnt that the same thing i did exactly what it said but it is still not right is it okay not good i am trying to do that second part i do not think this is going to work though yeah yes are you ready for the test i am not ready i mean the lab test in the method here and we would use our input changes again you said i had to change this i feel like crying do i have to use the four there right thanks you do not have time tomorrow you are going to the rock climbing thing tomorrow right so that means you cant study tomorrow yeah yeah a morning class at eight and my brother told me to get a package for him and i do not want to huh yeah,oh  yeah  imagine  must  difficult  anyways  yall  good  go  fun  started  short  using  statement  string  use  stubble  quotation  use  statement  check  user  input  like  idea  im  one  still  one  working  one  square  okay  ill  try  yeah  pokemon  yeah  pokemon  program  whatever  mean  actually  dont  know  say  error  oh  almost  done  one  huh  return  im  really  familiar  method  yet  drag  drop  yes  cant  drag  drop  feel  better  okay  awesome  think  error  yeah  flow  chart  yet  okay  yes  oh  sorry  oh  still  pseudo  code  flow  chart  didnt  use  method  one  huh  error  input  there  error  input  dont  know  still  give  error  say  name  method  dont  know  havent  started  flowchart  yet  dont  know  give  error  oh  pseudo  code  flowchart  ill  send  done  second  one  use  draw  flow  chart  think  going  take  flowchart  flowchart  flowchart  show  method  flow  chart  part  one  counting  vowel  oh  okay  bye  send  dont  know  send  though  save  sorry  dont  lot  space  desk  oh  yes  work  dont  get  yes  last  one  question  didnt  fill  completely  well  left  last  two  blank  question  hey  chris  chris  figure  yes  cant  really  find  selection  sort  head  sort  question  binary  yes  bubble  sort  eight  negative  isnt  oh  negative  nine  isnt  negative  say  got  wrong  oh  okay  dont  get  question  sorry  say  one  wrong  dont  know  else  find  alright  got  six  wrong  keep  like  would  keep  like  six  want  also  question  wrong  still  one  attempt  right  going  yes  mine  print  zero  yeah  done  mine  still  printing  dont  know  error  need  leave  minute

i think its recording now is there anything you want to say to the teachers before we start dude my heads right there what would she do if we just hit the pause and did everything and then resumed it why true or false what are you doing oh you confused the hell out of me yeah we have to entertain the teacher somehow no its the teacher listening she has to listen to all of these its disc golf not frisbee golf its disc golf yeah we did last time she had listen to him say fuck over and over and over our first recording we didnt realize it and we were going off on a tangent describe your dinner last night in as many descriptive words as possible thats a really uncomfortable word the noodle was very moist as it entered my mou that got better you cant do it thats what she said there you go you started this its now a competition can you outline it for us like sarah did last time for me i had it pretty much all done i needed a lot of assistance if  why would i do that wait we have a problem with were connected to the same recorder so he would have to come with me true we would each be in a different stall i dont care am i on the right track back to but i told him to enter one two three four five can we keep the pen richard it does come off you just need to apply a certain amount of pressure to the right area carefully whats up how do you return a string return a string what do you mean how do you do this alright can we attach that magnitude hey ill take the other half ive got two of them revenge is a bitch isnt it how many numbers have you pressed in my laptop lately this isnt working are you doing part one or part two oh i know thats why i was trying to do it with just do one two three or four and then you could figure out which one theyre doing from that but hes like it has to be a string i dont want to do a string im pretty sure thats what he said richard get what he has put it on discord send it to me and ill distribute check the crosstalk  the bugs are coming careful it would be a shame if it went missing oh i just did the first part well we can just say method ive got a quarter of it done hang on careful here you go ive been called worse things no its not i know dont worry all it does is match a so then you just have to fill int im not sure how we do little b but  are you talking to yourself its the only way he explained it i dont know any methods whats a method its how he explained it then do a method do you remember learning that does not where are we supposed to be looking so you do the calculations in a method and then we just print out in the ifelse so i have it i have it what you talking about i dont know seven years of building computers yeah cybersecurity crosstalk  yes programming no ive not used programming do you want to show us the first part so we can understand what were doing cause i think the crosstalk  the eight of us have no idea what were doing six and a half the method so how would i do a method for square theres too many methods but ok you can turn up its easy so far we have to learn not because its easy no go find that one semicolon thats caused it why are we doing int cause it could be a double no its difficult is switch int with double essentially i could just delete where it says double a for all of these and do the calculations down below and that would pass cool yeah crosstalk  bro hey chris yeah but that means we have to redefine the scanner for each one well youre the one grading it so  you jackass  what do you mean are you scared what what how do we do the mathematics for h to the underscore b height to bravo or base how are we supposed to do that is it depth just hit delete or backspace okay thats just confusing why add all that and then for two parts even though it says double n do we have to double width double height and declare them in the parenthesis yeah so there is height and base so i would have to do double oh yeah because i have it defined below so then its not required no i did it all here mmhmm affirmative i did a equals square i only did that because its down there dude im way ahead of you oh shit but i made chris give up i dont know if thats good or bad jesus wow its sarah what can you expect thats why we make lab so much fun no jesus is you cant beat jesus everyone needs jesus in their life where did you  oh its down there i was just like it fell off nope is it just a oh i know i just probably start with this we have a lab yeah and then you do the same thing for the rest of them kind of looks like pokemon dont serve me ill take it dude weve done it so much tonight it doesnt even matter well all still have to do assignment two its due sunday that one somewhere right there it doesnt work it doesnt work it doesnt fucking work does it work if i spell circle right nope wow chris doesnt work thats supposed to be double it doesnt like me many things dont like me sunlight doesnt like me turns me red i dont think so that doesnt make sense chris it doesnt work mmhmm affirmative terrible it takes the name and nothing else equal equal im having a brain fart what like  why is it doing that did you do the chris part right on purpose still doesnt work okay now it works im already done i did it as a double just in case you put in a seven by five instead of a seven so its returning a which is square so im declaring double s equals square which is what that is so then s goes into the output on that correct of course actually think i didnt do it life is not supposed to make sense its supposed to confuse you yes something more though its just near your face we dont want that everything is awesome   crosstalk  why is this on my keyboard you move no you move that way but your cords in the way you need to unplug it your cord no no no no no no i need to charge it fine move that way so i can move that way so stupid oh god everythings getting tangled hey andrew you can back up now see now weve got the circle what so every time you talk you have to say everything is awesome into the mic and then you keep talking because everything is awesome where is she everything is awesome awesome awesome awesome thats because you closed it dumbass none of this makes sense none of it makes sense no thats the patient whats the first thing that comes to your mind your face looks so constipated i got it to work just kidding it doesnt work  stop what because man look at this thats an array youre already failing but how do we get an input in an array well if you take their cry closet away youll definitely offend them what did i say if we take away the cry closet the entire university would be pissed off cry closet because they cant cope tommy what crack are you on what thats an array right there right there thats how you declare an array i did it because were not doing dot zero were already stumped how do we do this whats an array nope dont know how to do that yet i know i just wanted to create an array dipshit yes thats how you define it i dont want to define  all the way to  i feel like id be shooting myself how do we do this i already whats an array whats a prework but you have to do  through  there you go stagnant you get to hear everything he says later dont worry did i do this right i dont know i dont think so who wants to do this at home and make it due tomorrow  definitely said that talking to this somewhere did you get the set youre leaving yeah i pointed that out to chris and he pointed it out to you yeah there is no homework but there is no case study we dont know what were doing do you know what youre doing typically you just do it as an ent got two lines it says enter number and it captures the number thats it you said that already  seconds ago everything nothing is that supposed to be parentheses or bracket crosstalk  thats what you think is that supposed to be a bracket or parentheses does my loop at least look like crosstalk  mmhmm affirmative okay mmhmm affirmative this is terrible crosstalk  you havent gotten very far at all yeah but i already had this and then deleted it because i thought i was wrong crosstalk   everything is awesome crosstalk  what is number supposed to be just the random whatd you do crosstalk  soso crosstalk  that was so creepy crosstalk  dad here turn it this way ill go quickly crosstalk  or you just highlight it and copy paste crosstalk  its just not going properly crosstalk  i didnt want to say that doesnt go in properly crosstalk  what you go there bud crosstalk  confused i should just wait i should just wait what page crosstalk  dude your echo doesnt look fun shuffle everything crosstalk  yeah i can see it right here but it still does not look fun because im not gonna remember this for the test what does this do i dont know crosstalk  thats skipping because yeah put it this way you need a doctors note for it to be excused i was told that because i had a crosstalk  reaction on tuesday and i was on benadryl taking that test and i was crosstalk  then she was like you need a doctors note im like im not going for the doctor crosstalk  oh i had an allergic reaction on tuesday and they said you still have to come in for the test im like you have to self medicate what wheres the input your crosstalk   oh how long do you want it to be crosstalk  what happens if you do  do it bear with her crosstalk  ill fucking get this shit crosstalk  but its in the book i just dont understand what im looking at what we need to do is in the book i just dont understand what im looking at crosstalk  i hate this dude he just showed us a picture of his drivers license crosstalk  its hair here no beard crosstalk  can this be due tomorrow so we can  ive got a headache already ive got a headache i cant go anymore crosstalk  because chris is like oh this is gonna be really easy and the whole class is like i dont get this crosstalk  how are you feeling today i need nicotine crosstalk  withdrawal that usually accompanies the withdrawal if we just copy this whole thing will it work minus the dallas bit ignore that its in the book crosstalk  initializing with input initializing with random numbers displaying them it says display crosstalk  somewhere summoning all elements and then the rest is  nothing crosstalk  oh man if you knew what it was crosstalk  i could do all the way up to f at f im just gonna throw it in the bin crosstalk  its right here in the book i just realized it said no one ever i forgot how to declare a new file because crosstalk  so brain dead im just gonna try to copy the book for everything it has and see if it gets it and itll be done tomorrow because ive got a math placement test at  am lets just say the train was late arriving here and i missed it by five minutes crosstalk  we havent even gotten to the last crosstalk  cant do that is helping someone else toby needs food crosstalk  just a little bit of curry crosstalk  curry crosstalk  toby would you like more curry crosstalk  what crosstalk  inaudible  toby stay away from the curry thats perfectly clean crosstalk  all right dude im gonna go home im not getting any further in this you can stop crosstalk   i think its  is it  whats my number it is  i thought it was  im definitely  crosstalk  mine and yours crosstalk  this is my left hand crosstalk  what are you seeing what if a and b equal c theres no c squared its just a and b equal c crosstalk  their plan has failed epically crosstalk  i got the book hey dude weve got a group cohesion survey and its due on the th we could do that easy is it activity a yes it is crosstalk  some points of it we cant crosstalk  not yeet no yeet someone asked for crosstalk  there aint an array it says inaudible  going for the next question keep the fuck up no shit sherlock but were using it for the next question what the hell does part one do int array sets the array crosstalk  inaudible  array part two crosstalk  true yes they just try to mess you up because people will go in a linear fashion oh this is just saying some people will just ignore the comments that go one through  huh its just returning your values oh yeah yeah yeah array is set to a new array or i can just type it out give me a moment currently attempting to figure out all the parts reference suck it no  set to the exact same one nah its set to a new array im typing this stuff out so i have it in notes so i have notes you miss one you automatically get a  look at that buddy reference the saints huh wait what number are you on right but what number me too oh its reference and same same same good god get a hearing aid well then for whoever else who needs it or shit theres another kid i forgot wait whats question one oh wait am i just clearly just plugging and playing this hang on boys and girls why dont we just check it before method call  before method call five lets just make my life easier pull up this cord there you go well its zero and one why not you know the great thing is she gets to listen to your mic what did you learn things and objects and shes gonna go son of a bitch i should have told him something easier do you wanna stand up first and then sit down to make it easier on us lay down the lay there she is shut the fuck up i wanna agree but at the same time bro its inside the method eleven space five just look in discord you got anything to throw at him like something that will give a solid mark see i thought you were reaching for mine which is actually full of liquid less is wasted it is if he ducks space five yeah chris is awesome is david sick again i dont trust him alright whats the correct just scroll down hang on scroll up oh five and six alright got it do you need the answers which number this may be a while before we get back on track what flavor jungle juice is better tropical or mediterranean yeah reference just scroll up and down i thought thats what nicotine was for reference and same yeah reference then same ill make you feel worse i can cook a meal meant for four people sit here and eat the whole thing in front of you and you wont get a bite and ill still be hungry afterwards i dont know where it goes oh yeah they have that ive seen it no theres an actual app in a way that like you can check what the parking levels are in all the decks mmhmm affirmative its not associated with uncc someone just put it out there its on reddit for uncc no hey man im sitting right here yeah i think i ruined that for you crosstalk  get most of them out of ireland too well yeah i can see that well i mean i know both my great grandmothers came over on ships through ellis island during world war iiish so no s ish somewhere in there crosstalk  ah it froze this stupid piece of shit oh i did a paper on it due when yeah no its not sarah can you grab these from us because its due at   what  why is this question not in the book the definition not in the book well youre going to have to read what a bubble versus a linear crosstalk  actually is read between the lines its a lie theres key elements sequentially with each linear so compares key elements sequentially with each element is linear and then the second part is binary yeah the one inaudible  rocket ship its a little more than a quiz im searching   linear then binary its rubbing against i havent gotten there maybe the first though what the hell is this well its not why is it not showing oh theres nothing  can you just undo the wire so they can sit separate thats not my problem yeah its linear  because it matches exactly what i have three is linear capital s capital s searching inaudible  no  inaudible  is not calling anything did you i dont remember oh hes ahead of us congrats he doesnt have any horses inaudible  yes seven is binary hes just good at math what inaudible  mmhmm affirmative at the same time i feel like this is doing it wrong because this should be in here that way it pulls it no because its pulling this inaudible  right there so now its fine were stuck on inaudible  it is in the main method main because its just doing mystery method which comes here so it shoots through here and then it comes back and prints it out well from the last class that we had thats no surprise it shouldnt be wrong because its the same as this and this is straight from the book you can just minimize this if needed no thats right because lab  is what mines named inaudible  one for andrew you can still be tired chris do you want me just give it to you and you can sit down behind here the bubble code is wrong is the middle name madison is the middle name madison but ironically the code above is from the book so its got to be this nine is d scroll up go up the can you teach it to us online crosstalk  another way we can understand this way and then for the assignment crosstalk  actually no david was sitting at his laptop youre scrunching up the eye thats what sarah did or just do alttab to look at the browser now we got a negative one or we just do compile air because its wrong either way well we got three tries wait is it going to tell us whats wrong yeah theres three attempts but its still nice to know which ones the right way no no no no no this is not astronomy see the sad part is we found it the other day so please come find it again eight is negative one so then whats nine the array wasnt sorted to begin with theyre not going to come back here all right chris will even though there is no middle there is eight numbers is our recorder still on right because when aizeya is like our recorder is turned off im like now inaudible  hey just what you guys did with ten max whats ten fuck you whats eleven oh first oh no its okay oh because i saw smallest latest im like why is he saying wait what and then youre like smallest first to him and im like ah its not in the book oh wait it is in the book multiple phases neighboring crosstalk  ill wait for sarah to come back over here before i raise my hand davids a little bee nope hes wow and i play sea of thieves or battlefield  sorry buddy im not crosstalk  and and yeah but id rather meet people with real jobs making six figures than nerds playing games but they have no real life skills because all they do is play games no its not its entertaining to watch how little life skills they have after the games done your definition of entertaining no yeah but i dont watch sports well sports and esports im on  whats wrong with the oh its missing a bracket is that a beat surprise its not drawing anything i dont know what the fuck it does its different from what the book has its different from the book these are both from the book this is i dont know what that is i dont recognize it so it is bubble in that picture im the bubble ass i dont know what was the question here after the ta this is a bubble right because i got the bubble sort right here is that a bubble sort i dont know its different from the book it is this is a bubble sort no i dont know can you tell us what its not i dont know what it looks like because its different from the book very different and the sad part is this is the selection and this is the bubble so its different from inaudible  inaudible  bubble i dont remember no its crosstalk  no i hate this get rid of this i dont want to do it no i dont want to do this shut up what oh yeah thats right yeah it is wait wait wait we missed one it is well whats a merge sort i read over it no thats selection mmhmm affirmative yeah because thats selection right here dont expect that to well how whats  its the same thing with  is this even right code how do we know this is going to work whats question ten oh i dont want to know that why dont we just do this at home what inaudible  class at  inaudible   fucking minutes to get home lets get this chicken so im inaudible  for ten what you got for nine turn around you can get a rest of it im just being sarcastic we only have ten were only missing three but she hasnt gotten to nine so im telling her to turn around and join the collective that is not azaya isaac bubble whats going on with my life take the l in time not bubble sort what is this i dont know what inaudible  whats going on get the fuck out i dont know what  is even asking me yo inaudible  whats going on i feel like its missing something yeah but where are we supposed to call okay i cant oh i have to do what i did with my assignment no its not working im not understanding this shut up who knows whats going on i dont fuck this shit im doing it this way its not working see i added that which is from that but its not working can we just take the l fuck my life ill take the l do you know its going to suck if it doesnt show me what i did wrong it doesnt show what i did wrong what oh its because its multiple parts see multiple parts in it  thats why and almost on point inaudible  wait whats number one i did but im retaking it whats number three oh its go four one five okay crosstalk  i tried it it does not work no no no no no why give us code if we cant fix it man i dont have crosstalk  put it this way if its wrong its a  out of  inaudible  up my grade this has dropped my grade uh no i fucked up his poll he got a  inaudible  a minute every time and then she gives us  seconds for the first three well its like inaudible  im like hmm whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait what of what number of what number oh i feel like youre making this shit up oh wait wait wait no theyre all there here oh i know but wait whats  i forgot the last two damn it the wrong one whats ten you forgot a number toby whats ten toby just take it and then tell it to the rest step one the equal three toby read it out loud  six toby whats three smaller or larger eight as we finish the last smaller whats step seven wait step seven is less or higher oh nevermind amid oh smaller  i believe we didnt need are you good because were missing with six you just added the six to the end of them im doing what youre doing what if we just twocrosstalk  so what if we did in eye see where it says equal zero change that to two oh that was unreal yeah its because i forgot the array no that one i know what i did wait come back here got it hahaha bro youre wrong i got them threw them all and ill share them mmhmm affirmative  inaudible  won the last one  why are you sticking this near my mouth   or  i dont remember are you sure or  what about  i though you were  and i was    im just waiting for him to walk in here with wings and everyone go wah what high school nevermind dude hes wearing a shirt with eggs and bacon on it  ill be his partner hes getting some food dry rub wet rub who knows what happened so i should cut your food and this is why i get so prepared for the chase try the link i just sent you for the book i knocked it over fixed it is that the link you have cause the website i just went to it i looked i got two of them open works for me yeah so he doesnt have to lug around a giant book youll get some comments in from him for chatting with each other oh its right behind where you are crosstalk  what you need to do is tell them to meet you outside woodward hall on cameron blvd right before the intersection where theyre building they probably dont even think anything of it so i found out an easier way than having to doinaudible  do you know what to do you just do this one line and it counts for row and column i dont know i havent gotten it to work yet no hes stretching it chris here chris line  suck it crosstalk  i dont know how he is still alive right now what ask what yeah how long did it take to grow your hair how long has it been since you had your picture id taken until now couple years there yeah go two years  that requires you to have a brain oh no we need to fill in this firstcrosstalk  wow i thought it was random for the column and the row number okay for almost all of it or just inaudible  then i read that wrong as well cause i thought we had to do another method where the ray was in there and then tie it into the main and i was like im going to shoot myself with this man im so glad i ordered my food before class i just kill them all right now dude class is almost over add the star between the parenthesis and the nine so its plus two because the numbers have to the rows and columns have to be between two and nine yeah so you multiply it by nine i thought it was because it went between two and nine yeah but look at this math after random nine minus two plus one plus two so yours is nine plus two minus two plus two it does the same thing that has a one in it that shouldnt have a ones thanks this is  chase what was yours nine plus two minus one plus two all right it seems to be fine yeah but then we have to do a four loop for adding all the columns each one has to be displayed and then we have to do the total sum of all the numbers in it no for the whole thing so all the columns together is the final sum after displaying that column a through whatever are these are all the averages and this is average for all the numbers together good god man i thought that was on your head i was like holy shit no wonder hes deaf well thats what i gave you thats what i gave you that will print it if you just put in your modified arithmetic and then all we have to do left is do a four loop for the sum of each column and then the sum of all the numbers together and then if you keep everything as inaudible  it will make your life a little easier hopefully you can see how original i am inaudible  you can put it inside of the array and then shoot yourself chase all we need is for her to say yeah well extend it dude im about to fall asleep i cant think anymore do you want some teddy grahams yup well i was just creating it underneath so i equals zero and just do it as i chris question inaudible  where should we figure out the sums cause i was going to put it at the end but hes thinking of adding it row column okay so if its m and n m is rows going down n is columns yeah no its got to be the same in java the rows are done first cause its two dimensional array yes yeah where should we be putting the four loop to figure out the arrays sum for each column and the average i dont know im trying to figure out put it at the end of the whole thing well dont we have to put it in an array it goes rows first i know that its supposed to be two by nine is this going to be a lot to do later tonight cause oh damn tomorrow because we only have ten minutes left yes i mean you could pull that one from the bottom if you want how loops are you right now nevermind thats a stupid question someones got to be punny ah its the second one yeah i know i did that for the longest time cause i hate it dude i cant believe that actually worked is that the  inaudible  do these windows open so i can through food out of it please ah with enough pressure yes so now you have to copy this and brackets does this also do the accumulative you did it like that i was like oh my god do it again it will give you an extra y and the extra y is hey chris can you take these things  i think its  is it  well i thought i was  youre   thats what i just said  why did i think i was  always been  im messing with you i am  and its activity  its like fate im still not gonna get it laughs ha ha ha let me just take that off your hands all right ethan turn around ethan face the group  there you go were all inclusive emily is way over there  what time  the time stamp is always important day year month and time  time  start   i have no idea i tried it twice yesterday and i just couldnt find the minimum  ha ha ha dont do that  uh inaudible  crosstalk  is that bubblegum  what  what  it just tastes like bacon juice without anything in it im not   you get one more yes  it was on comedy central  no im being serious  the super troopers  so there is three dudes in the car in the beginning i can actually just show it to you  cops pass and theyre like quick eat all of these mushrooms and while youre at it can you swallow all this weed so hes got it all in him and then the cops talk to him and hes just like  crosstalk  hits him he doesnt see it coming whoa ho and then they get arrested at some point and then another vehicle goes by and then they chase the car and they get to a bar they leave the three guys the three crosstalk  inaudible  and the fucking kite is licking the glass thats separates them and says the snowberries tastes like snowberries man thats the greatest thing shes gonna listen to it later and shes gonna hear that better be zyrtec and youre just gonna be like i hope so  yes  and thats why i was like im not gonna say it dot i hate this  come closer emily  shes kinda when these two are left alone and then weve got like the circle of  all right here ethan  ethan you move next to emily and max will come over  crosstalk  what are you dong scoot over so max can come join the circle  watch out there are a couple outlets between you and here  can i get a bowl with its bone pizza  bring your birth certificate  bring everything everything  who wants a boneless pizza a boneless pizza they are recording that i am selling them on ebay  do you not understand me state that again in the con voice  what are they doing why are they all lifted down what are they doing thats terrible  i dont think were going to get anything done today  do us a favor and shut up  in my pocket in front of the vending machine  like theyre saying ill give you a raisecrosstalk  inaudible  im waiting to see crosstalk  inaudible  dude i got hit by a baseball in the throat  im trying to figure out the second one  did you just get sucked into the void or something like why is it shitty why cant you people just get like a vape like normal idiots  yeah noah what conditioner do you use  nice  wait a minute thats already taken care of  you guys are just gonna keep these back for use  yo we try to have an extravagant conversation just to see how long it will take for her to say all right you guys just dont get this anymore what the second one  thats what she said  but then when she walks away well all be like sarah and then shell come back and itll kinda be like hey hey hey every time carefully  crosstalk  see its supposed to do this but it doesnt do this at all cause then hes smart go with him  we make jokes about him  mmhmm affirmative  all right i need help but chris cant give me the level of help  crosstalk  dont worry ill be here at like  am on friday chris  but we just get there at  so  the black hole  the best prank to do is take a blue pill take a blue power aid take the power ade drop the pill in close it give it to your buddies  theres actually ill have to find it on youtube but theres public static void and then i dont know this is what i used but if its for a number verses  he has enough problems as is  where do we start laughs oh come on are you serious  see he sits behind the desk and i come talk to him when he gets bored  im gonna get here at like  on friday  wednesday that might have been it man that sounds like a lot of sarcasm  yeah once you ruined it i was just like you guys are the light of my life im just like sarcasm  i dont know whats going on because i havent really been taught much cause im looking up oh i forgot yours was touch screen  return  yep and then you just put the name above  i need more crack  how much are you looking for a couple ounces a couple milligrams  you want one  have you ever had a nerd rope  i think so this is a little easier to eat  emily i have biology next semester a d im just like this is going to be a whole new hell that ive never done  you need one up here too because look thats your error right there  crushed red pepper yes i thought he meant black pepper  why dont we just take activity  and cut it into piece and then just add in what we need  thats what i just did  that was me trying really hard not to sneeze and then i released it  we had a i actually had a coworker that would refer to himself and be like brandon tucker does not like how youre talking to him and i was like  brandon tucker needs to shut the fuck up  what is it called  toby  yeah it was to the point where he was like brandon tucker shouldnt have to do this brandon tucker didnt have to deal with this at his old job brandon tucker should stop talking in the third person  come back into the circle of life that is currently the circle of confusion  equal to shit i didnt know it was that easy  you look so captivated like that youre so captivated listening to her keep going  what he didnt finish you got a couple years to enjoy it  sarah can we get this extended to be due tomorrow because its almost  oclock and were not very far into this  could we just get it extended now so the rest of us can go home  its a lot but its due at   oh its unlocked  no  was randomized rows and columns and fill in the middle and then it would give you the sum of each column and then the sum of all the columns so what im saying here is take that cut the array into its own  dude that would be entertaining because i always i have one person that i know  sarah dont say that  um yeah but put it this way i was much skinnier and much smaller yeah so max i went to great clips well my mother took me there and was like  take a little off the top because my hair was like this dude just goes whoomp i looked like i came straight out of auschwitz  its too late  what are you doing  aww poor you buddy  im gonna probably say no but keep going mmhmm affirmative probably cause you cant just put array you have to declare what it is  yeah but like mine is a terrible example because there is very little there but so i did the array in its own method to make my life easier  and i just called it up there and ill put it right there and i actually did something that worked and i dont know how i did it now  ohhhh  wait scroll all the way up hmm was gonna say if you want put that as like a static because then you can use it anyway ask the teacher she is right here  all of it laughs  why you got to sit in the corner this is like the worst place for you  you need professional help  yeah i cant find it on campus  i just need like a puppy okay  only during finals week and you have to be there thirty minutes before it starts because the line   yeah i saw that online and i was like you gotta be joking and then she was like yep thats very popular ill just bring my dog and it can pee everywhere  you should put in how many rows and how many columns and it just puts out what would be in between  did you start using it yet or is it just the start up  i dont know what that does to you  what does that well the easiest way to clean out your sinuses is to go to harris teeter and go to the hot pepper sauce get the dragon pepper well ill bring it in tomorrow if needed just a little bit on your pinky it will clean your sinuses out in seconds its wonderful it lasts for three hours we used it at work i brought in a bottle and we all were like and all of us for five minutes straight were just blowing our noses and then were like we can smell for three hours we were good and then played start building up and then do it again  and youre just like trapping them they come in and youre just like you dont know how to give them back up  on a ta yeah  um i hate this desk dude my hamstrings are tight yeah but i dont want to be sitting like this  well this is also the guy who cracked it once with  g fuel is what you should be drinking yeah but how is it better i just realized ive been pushing yourself backwards makes a lot of sense  i dont think its kicked in yet yeah it has kicked in  i skipped part one thought thats how i called it see at the top how it is just array i am a very slow worker and there is a lot of sugar man i can feel the sugar yeah max that is as far as i got i can fill it with zeros does that count  zero and total  im kinda tempted tot do the coding boot camp over the summer so i can be better at it  one two oh shit go all the way through the fucking alphabet numbers when you hit nine then go backwards eight  were gonna be at this for a while why did you let me pick  oh  wait do it again one two by three one two four four four five seven  okay do what ever   quit your wining because im right  either way your math sucks youre supposed to be dividing by the number of columns so its divided by three either way its wrong  should we get this disabled emily you look like you are about to fall asleep  well im like i know that thing but shes like  why od you have to bring that up we know its broken is it like one of those things like when its slightly off by the spelling and you have to bring it up every time for vision  thats how i can say that  see thats where i would just do an hdmi cord  an hour  ooo a senior exit project yeah that sucks  mine was i did needle project and i never had to do a senior exit project  in south carolina gasps  im still a bean  ive got scoliosis so if you straighten my spine im   ha ha   jesus christ  aww stop it  yeah when i was in high school i was  and  and i was stuck like that for eight years i was about    in high school i mean middle school  dude my growth spurt was so painful yeah yeah because my legs were growing at a rate that my knee caps couldnt keep up  no it would be in the middle of the day like i would get home from school and i would just sit on the floor because it hurt so much  there we go  chris can you take these  were not allowed to turn it off right  i know sarah added you   as the prophecy foretold  we should be able to change his nickname  there you go  it was jesus for all of five seconds and then you changed it this is terrible  the what hes got to set up the long way just got to be creative  just put it on the ledge behind him  youre welcome thats why they pay me the big money  chase just put it in your hoodie  yeah say your numbers  im guard   well we dont have lab and i dont have the night class  our lab is canceled yeah were free on fridays well this friday not next friday this friday were good   so i think that counts for    i know i have friends a lot younger than me this feels weird i work with people all  yet with my mental age i fit in perfectly we know isaiahs favorite work is nicotine  i try not to curse so im just going to go  i was not fucking  you free on friday are you free on friday how about saturday after  oclock  im free all the time everyday life of a student  i dont know the paychecks a lot nicer  hey buddy man i hope she doesnt listen to this tomorrow  you know what would be more fun just come in with a bottle of titos but have it be water and just be drinking out of it see how long it takes for someone to go um that might be a little too sensitive right now  no no if anything ill just bring in cards against humanity we could just play that in the back  ive got enough that way the whole class could play wed still have extra cards  no but ive got the hey guys its good friday lets get lit come to the bridge come underneath the bridge where the tent fire is  its good friday  ive been looking at this loop for like  minutes because i dont know what to put in it  im off on friday  ive printed the slot machine now i have need to put ones in it  yeah friday mornings you always work friday morning got to wash those dishes  its either a zero or a one  this sets us up for doing part of assignment four if we can get this then we come start designing the character has to start at  which is the top left corner then you chose do you want to move left right up down you encounter an animal or you dont and you keep going until the person quits so this will set it up  its also due in  days its due on the th you need to play catch up  well youre going to ditch that birthday youre going to come party with us friday oh yeah its good friday we have friday off no lab so were going to get drunk and play cards against humanity or something i know its like shoot whered it go  no were just doing this  by all of six inches maybe a foot foot and a half  its times nine right times nine got it that was easy  like that  im going to do a just to test it  we can just look to our left and see it because it also lets you if she has a doodle pad she can just write it  because i was like we have to do a four loop and then it has to repeat  wait thats got to be inside my four loop  wait does it have to be in another method redundant actually  oh my god i forgot how to do a random number  was that the start of a loopy was that what that was thats all i remember  i made it that far  its one minus zero one plus zero max and min its one over zero  main ray i was hoping i could get it while you were typing you just keep going and be like wheres the error role call  y times  because its supposed to be a one or a zero  so am i basically doing the  ive been using that for nine hours today  to win the game it has to line up  vertically not horizontal they cant line up horizontal good luck doing it diagonal because that just sounds painful especially for your first attempt  well ive got a problem now its generating more than nine ones  youve got a major lemon why thank you at least someones not lazy like the rest of us  i said at least someones not lazy like the rest of us  scallywag  yes  ive seen the peaches  where are they oh my god this things like so warm he was using my charger because his phone almost died thing is just so warm you actually got it to work all right chris where do i go from here im trying to get it to generate  shes like you can do the rest im like i dont know wait call oh i did it i did it yeah  hey chris im a dammit genius i just did it first try  i was like where are you going with this yup  oh just do display but will that repeat it as well well i did more than  oh is it because i have display right there i was doing one on top of the other  its supposed to be a five by nine thats a lot more than five  so do i really have to give them the option to hit enter can i just do it this way so how far have you gotten i havent started okay  good god man i got to squint to look at it i might as well be squinting at it over there might get a couple heads there as well  i did it without the enter  i did this without realizing it would do that  i dont know what i did either  so it just displays the array  what right here tristan callie scallywag  his last names scallion so they just call him scallywag  shes gong to hear herself and then shes going to hear you go hey i have no idea what she just said to me i know  that was terrible  that way it would work between them thats why its the light brown where did oh shes way over there  i have to explain to a noncomputer user how to reset her computer  no but its resetting the pram on a macbook that way it fixes  well hey if you really want to i already did five for you it works  yes it does  yup  what do you mean  it puts the one in aray into place and says press enter you dont have to do any work at all  yes show me what i did wrong because chris wont  what because theyre smarter than us  i am thats why i said us theyre smarter than me and us  no you dont  do shift home shift home then you just hit up up up done  thank you  yeah but now i have to do it to the point where it checks to see if it lines up correctly either you win or you dont win  oh no i did it wrong chase ive done it wrong  so it prints it the first time when you hit enter it goes you didnt win  you know i dont think of these things right  it works even though   technically this is me this is me this is sarah this is chris  because mines better  no one likes change its okay  yours done your code do you want to see mine should i be putting the code with the discord from now on i dont really care enough it allows you to check it when im not here i learn off of looking at what youve done and then changing it  its like when i play with a computer ill take the whole thing apart and then rebuild it and then i understand  id just do zero to two or zero to three and make it  zero to four and it has to line up with three  which is why we dont even give him the ability  loser is the next user have you ever hear of  its the bastard operator from hell is the system admin on a campus who just fuck entirely with ever other user hell delete like half the print queue and therell be a line of students waiting for their stuff to come out  oh my god  there you go i put the first one in  did you just call me chris im going to take it as a compliment though  i already printed out six arrays without meaning to i was just trying to get one to appear  this is going to be great when she has to listen to all of this  she hears silence suck my butt number  is vulgar creative but vulgar  because its the parentheses times nine because it does zero to one so youre multiplying  we dont have class tomorrow together youre talking about thursday  ive got our bullshit class then we go to lunch then ive got sociology dude i ripped my teacher a new one yesterday that was great he took off points because i changed up how the powerpoint goes im like in an email so youre taking points off for being different i wanted to add on have the last  years not helped you with anything but i was like that may be too far  hes on borderline racist everyday he was like all terrorists are from the middle east aggressiveness is due in part due to firearms  damn it  great youre part of the free folk were screwed  man you got nothing  because when i did the close parentheses it jumped  what how do you change the colors i forgot how  color  mine came like that i dont know  thank you  oh syntax color yeah yeah yeah  theres a better way because i had it to the point where it was showing me a bunch of different color formats you could choose from i had to reinstall eclipse because of jen  i had to reinstall this because it broke itself  that was painful having to go back through the video to make sure i did it right it was awful where did chris go i see sarah i see david i see the teacher where did chris go no hes still here hes back there hes just sitting  oh his back is to us thats why  carefully  son of a son of a sailor jimmy buffet  thats not bad at all  no  it that what you want sum plus or minus n then it prints out the result this was two weeks ago lab part four  dude i save them all i just  it wasnt last week it must have been the week before  okay but this is only a single aray not a d aray  so you have to adapt it  what is this i was like can i have your vape dumb ass no i knew he was a dumb ass  like the energizer bunny eventually does need a recharge  white rice or brown rice its true yes but  please continue youve got two more youve got max an emily  were easy targets  oh how am i the easiest i think i ruined curry for you  its bullshit  can you stop making sense wait a minute  dudes

what is this i have no idea what the fuck im doing  chris now you return a string hey chris yes i wanna return even or return false even or odd i mean not even or false it says put in a number and then put in a meth and then oh it says put in a number and tell what itll be odd or even yeah thats what i was gonna do boolean but like  yeah but like  for this part yeah but how does print this numbers even and whatnot okay i dont get it where oh yeah i see that yeah but then i got this and i dont know what to do with that so i guess that would be yeah you twit come on you dumbass oh okay so thats how you do that so got it its already important once whats the point of this stop tabbing i dont like that go back no i hate  stop it no no no ten  three man i am having trouble typing today oh my god i may have done it alright yall i think i did question two my code works unbelievable oh shit its too big alright my code doesnt work dang it doesnt have to be a string oh yeah it does i dont understand why my code isnt working maybe should just put on my side i know right dang my arms getting tired i only have one arm alright whats hanging up there dammit there we go shit i dont understand i just dont know how to  inaudible  this up my damn if equal to im doing question two by the way oh my god my code works oh yeah it works alright first one  why wont just make this entire discord a group chat my method works alright how you doing on question one i guess ill help you out with that this is activity  isnt it dang this one is not easy so its gonna be a its gonna be four methods how do you do four methods what oh i get it thats easy easy mode nevermind thats not easy mode uhoh thats just a variable oopsies okay i dont know this is dumb easy so you just fill in all the formulas for each elseif is it gonna be elseif or do we do if for each one and then else much better cant spell square lol i am talking to myself whats a method yeah this is just a bunch of ifelses yeah but you have to use four methods im sorry i dont speak english i dont understand why we have write four methods when its so much easier to do elseifs like this so then its correct but where this is should be a public et cetera for each bit i dont understand what you just said okay dumb ive done nine years of building computers and ive done two years of programming all im literally doing is i dont understand the using a method yes public static int  so you do public static int one shape public static int some other shape public static int some other shape but why would i do that when elseif is so much easier when is it really applicable yeah its awesome and then when you fix that one thing it all works so great no its not were not doing doubles too much work no excellent why is it called double in where does the in come from is in the input we just gonna change to whatever input was oh wait oh man oh man oh my god no no this is confusion int i kinda understand the  kind of i understand the four methods and whatnot but i dont understand when the input comes in its asking for  you type in some side how you tell the method to get  do i put the  fuck including asking for the input i would put ask in the input within each of these methods okay that makes sense to me then sounds great this thing is damn obnoxious okay can i use the same variables within different methods oh thats awesome okay so i would do it i have to do double for circle that sucks i have to do double for triangle were just gonna leave that on the ground that requires effort bubble supposed to say double double bubble doublewobble wobbledouble wow thats completely messed up out of curiosity im gonna declare size as an integer or whatever well that sucks so what do i do just that okay that sounds great all right lets get these scanners in input cannot be resolved oh i have to call it shut up i think jesus is its a variable just to bring it up scanner scanner scanner blah blah blah oh boy hey sarah hey chris i dont understand these errors yeah it says method must result a  oh i need to put return up here no no not intro this is global science class okay and then what yeah area is that it cool okay your side equals inputnext  dang i started to do assignment two and i know theres no plugin capable what am i going to do now whats my life chris what variables do i need the heights and base you dont work didnt work im dicks i need dicks why does that not work i dont like you this is just height times base all over it divided two times base makes perfect sense the scanner can do  its a thing oh my god what did you do for the first part shape that equals   i dont get it no no no i have it all done i just dont know what to do for the ifelse stuff i dont understand this what double s  wait square i dont understand why youre doing double s square i dont get that i dont understand why that entire line is there so is it so for me it would be like this it would be int s equals square well that didnt work at all wait what did you call you called  oh fuck this shit this is so fucking stupid double a area return a this is so  this so does not make sense i dont get this what you get both of them i get both of them all right stop the recording silence did he fuck it up last time fucked up okay my number is  kind of jump in here because were going to turn this is unbelievable we have to be so close scoot over over there all right im still   whos  the window its so bright everything is awesome everything is awesome hey andrew andrew how is everything why is eclipse taking so long to load its because of those files you installed you dont have to install anything to make it dark it all makes sense all of it makes sense all right yall this is going to be so easy all right yall were going to fill an array you ready to make an array im ready type make an array im ready to make an array wait how do you make an array where theres a will theres array where theres a way theres a way is that a chinese way of saying crosstalk  it sounds like my professor trying to say  sounds like my professor trying to say theres a will theres a way theres a will theres a way a will a way huh crosstalk  a will theres array yeah my professor she has a really strong accent she cant say her ws and rs very well so they kind of sound the same so theres a will theres a way what are you doing stop it yeah but we have to give the input for how many we want you take the user input awesome im tired microaggressions unc astral has a literal lecture for orientation about microaggressions and all that its the worst thing ive ever gone through im a macro aggressor i offend the whole college if you take away their  still a pain did someone say crack hey how do you make an array go to the array thing go to it hurry hurry hurry go go go go you mean  sugar making you hyper is actually a myth it just gives you diabetes hey okay i probably should do that itd be really obnoxious to hear go back to oh does it have to be a double oh true thats an array right there thats an array right there look see i did it right yeah i told you i literally told you like two seconds ago we had to get the  oh so thats how you make it do you have to use the brackets i see no go i just want to get the format thats all i need all i need is the format i can be done with this code where is it where is it where is it where is it hello like this hello oh god what is new ent what boy somehow do i put stuff in the array oh ive got another loop right you make a loop like in the array with that okay so do you just make a loop that  well yeah but like what im so confusion im trying to figure out how to put data in an array wow this answer has negative two why am i on this website terrible maybe you shouldnt admit that over forum oh my god i figured it out guys check this shit out are you ready for this you ready for this you ready for this you ready for this you ready for this so this puts  in slot zero this puts  in slot one this puts two and slot two how does the four loop go again i hate you and equals zero is i less than equal to array length and then we do and then we do and then we do i plus plus jesus i think ive figured it out random crosstalk  i dont get it lets see here area number my array i equals shit on a stick how do i generate a random number i forgot its like  fuck oh god number holy crap i have to go back to my notepad damn it i have to go back all the way back to some bullshit you are such a  number of grades cannot convert double from int i dont want to do method at random oh my god i cant generate a random number fricking integer no i dont know how to generate a random number thats not a double and i need up there but it wont let me do ent you have to do ent thats obnoxious but now im still getting an error unbelievable number may not initialize numbers up there my array looks really funky crosstalk  how do i print the values that sounds awful oh its still not even doing a thing right sounds great amazing oh its another four loop interesting crosstalk  impossibrew ron stoppable crosstalk  what numbers a random number its generated up here then its printed to there crosstalk  maybe crosstalk  something ive got some thingywingys so many loopy loops its loops and loops and loops and loops and loops and loops and loops why whats wrong with my thing oh god oh cool i did it guys crosstalk  boom crosstalk   its got to print  times no ive got to figure out whats wrong first crosstalk  what is el wrongo crosstalk  i need to delete this one crosstalk  inaudible  check it out check it out check it out check it out check it out check it out crosstalk  largest numbers nine roy i have to check it i want to get rid of the printing thing crosstalk  do you have to print the array crosstalk  where im confusion crosstalk  wait how do you print the index crosstalk  index crosstalk  yeah the i value but  holy shit jesus crosstalk  its inside the loop crosstalk  you have to pull it out of the loop somehow you have to make  crosstalk  roy im using i j and k for each of my loops i dont know how to pull out an index from a loop i dont know how to pull out the index for the max value that i found crosstalk  yeah max equals my array add something in the loop crosstalk  goes through here on j how do i pull that j out crosstalk  do i just need j crosstalk  no i cant do that my array dot  okay blank its gonna work watch crosstalk  dang crosstalk  no it aways is oh and then you just print j plus j thats just crosstalk   index crosstalk  yeah i get it crosstalk  oh wait no it wouldnt because its in the loop roy whyd you put it in the loop crosstalk  god crosstalk  chris come on dude crosstalk  no it said crosstalk  index may not be able to initialize and my array delete crosstalk  wait wheres my array crosstalk  crosstalk  be five six is the index crosstalk  where did you find this crosstalk  to me crosstalk  its in the book dude noggin crosstalk  i dont have a noggin crosstalk  do you know how to print a comma in array like print out the array and then put commas and spaces in it to separate crosstalk  i can get the array except for crosstalk  i want to put commas and spaces crosstalk  one crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  i guess this is the crosstalk  right here so what do i just do oh wait then i would just do this crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay i got it crosstalk  yep yep i got it so easy crosstalk  comma plus crosstalk  man that is the best looking array ever except i have a comma after the six that looks stupid crosstalk  how do i get rid of that last comma crosstalk  i would have to do an if something ill just do a space fuck it crosstalk  brain dead brain hurty now youve got to inaudible  the average of all the elements crosstalk  ive got to do something tomorrow i dont know what yikes crosstalk  all right guys more loops here we go crosstalk  jesus i know crosstalk  all except f crosstalk  oh my god ive got to do so many variables j k l m n o p q r s t u v oh and crosstalk  letters crosstalk  total crosstalk  whats wrong here crosstalk  oh lets just make it equal to zero crosstalk  average crosstalk  equals total divided by crosstalk   im doing great crosstalk  five plus seven plus six plus seven plus six divided by five crosstalk      divided by five all right my average works sweet next crosstalk  find all elements that have a higher value than the average value oh god and then crosstalk  array called high values so many loops crosstalk  at j k l m equals zero crosstalk  i want to get this done really crosstalk  im about to be finished crosstalk  thank you crosstalk  silence  no youre  yeah no youre  im  all right looks like the activities crosstalk  are open wait theres activity a theres activity b and theres activity c that doc then theres activity c submission what are we doing for activity a and b crosstalk  oh yeah we could all circle crosstalk  oh god this is not gonna work oh god oh god oh god oh god youve got to go under the table i cant crosstalk  it off with my right hand because of that crosstalk  this is my  turn your fist around crosstalk  how many crosstalk  all better okay are we doing  what are we doing i dont understand huh you have activity  a b and then c doc and then theres only activity c submission thats that transitive property oh its a quiz oh all right lets do these quizzes real quick crosstalk  sarah never answered my email oh man this is so much work already i just want to go home im so hungry sounds great crosstalk  i dont know is it crosstalk  isnt this possible except  no its not possible because theres not enough variables crosstalk  you would need an int w int v int x and int whatever y you would need four integers essentially right crosstalk  no but youre doing four different things we have defeated him before he got  i just realized how were just using x and y to multiply and divide and plus and subtract it thats what i just found out guys can you return all four answers crosstalk  oh you put them in array and then you can return them yes index zeros addition and index one is subtraction index two is yeet  and then index four is something else crosstalk  yeet yes no youve got to put them in a goddamn array thats not an  oh that is an array crosstalk  youre not even printing it youre just running it not printing anything youve got to print it thats not printing anything good go man part one good go man part one brah no its just an empty array isnt it then part two crosstalk   why is part five after part one all right part two  all right its a different array with four values crosstalk  four size four after the array is compiled its going to be eight four twelve zero yeah because it hasnt run the next line yet and part four is going to return it wait isnt four  oh  divided by  okay part  array equals a no you did that in part four so the array is set to the new one alright fill in that blank what is that the blank of the array is returned the i mean the values are  is it value or values i mean weve just got to search for it in the book apparently here we go the reference of the array did i spell reference right oh god no hopefully i spelled that right  out of  thats not bueno oh we missed part five fuck what okay thats so stupid question   question   damn dude we got a  on that thats terrible alright b here we go crosstalk  alright time to search for more stuff in the book why are you doing that to study oh my god this one is fucking  questions unbelievable ant b of zero is  ant b of  is  im on quiz  number  i skipped i skipped number  i dont feel like looking up that bullshit its reference and what sane same i dont need a hearing aid i just need  a hearing aid laughs inside the method blah blah blah the value of num is equal to one juan num zero is  three for question three isnt a outside the scope its not in that scope okay great references oh god i think so oh yeah lab zero one okay but after the call whats a no i cant see what method  i cant see that you have to get to the code alright im going to the code fuck it after the method  so after the method its still  and then after methods two oh man alright number five thats false it has to be returned right i think its not in the scope but it should be right it should be one two three isnt six also false because its not returned i got  five six four i got  and two did you all get false for five and six for five and six are we assuming that the values are returned or not returned because theres nothing saying about returned so that just means theyre gonna be both false because they dont update if theyre not returned but is it implying it well it doesnt matter because if it doesnt return its not gonna change anything because its gonna stay in that method right alright i dont know anything okay an array is an object correct why i dont understand why it updates why would a variable not update but an object would that makes no sense if its in a different scope why would it change oh god oh god i dont wanna think about this so is that true for all objects how do you know that six is false then or true professor im confused about question six like why are objects updated in the main method but variables are not okay yeah okay okay does this apply for all objects in java okay so because its referencing its address if you change its address in one method its gonna change in the other one because you cant like  theyre not values necessarily so they cant discern or whatever okay mmhmm affirmative i know machine language i took a class on it references or value okay okay okay so what were pulling from the main method is the reference not the value of the reference so if you change the value of the reference in the other method that reference points back to the main methods and changes that value because you cant change values or like you cant change a reference so  well you can change a value in reference but the reference is gonna change it in the other method because theres only one  yeah yes okay that makes sense yes yeah thats fine potatoes its eleven space five things and objects and pointers and references no that makes sense like if you  so alright im gonna explain it so she doesnt feel bad when shes listening alright im gonna explain this to you all here let me lay down the law for  i dont know oh whats your question so like since its an object it doesnt pull the value from the main method it only pulls a reference from that main method so anything you do to that reference in the other method whether it changes the value or anything its gonna change it in that sense its just a pointer to the other method so you wanna agree but what alright whats eight number eight seven is  space five one two one space five yes this increase theirs yeah wait what did you say number eight was whats number eight i said increase there is doesnt return a value while increase nine does not i said that increase theirs doesnt return a value and increase mine does is that the difference oh boy wait so whats number eight mmhmm affirmative okay okay got it i love jolly ranchers theyre so good that watermelon oh my god its so good blueberries and then grape and then green appel and then red cherry is the worst red cherry is just gross i dont like green apple yeah i got them yes so eight crosstalk  oh can you go to question three real quick okay so i got those how about question one references and same question two ten five six i think i got those too references and same or reference and same or references okay three i got watching three not in scope four is ten and two five is false six is true seven eleven space five c and then copies is your submit button not turned green sweet alright activity  is gonna be easy yeah check out what im making uh oh where is it uh oh thats not bueno well ill be a shit on a  shit i deleted the workspace with the code that i was working on no its long gone i deleted the work space damn that kind of sucks oh well she smelled it from over there you know what i really dont feel like doing anything right now i just wanna go to sleep and eat some chili my roommate made some chile im gonna smash a bowl of it when i get home its gonna be so good but youre the ta so you can do that you can do that you can because youre the ta i deleted an entire workspace for a long ass thing of code i was doing on accident and now i cant get it back you cant bring back a workspace like that i deleted the workspace i didnt realize i didnt put the code in this workspace it was in another one it was so long it was like  lines or something now its just gone it was parking meter check thing like it would check if a parking space was open and if it was closed it would have the time remaining on that parking space just for fun oh im not doing that im parked so yeah got rid of that entire code but it was messed up anyway so its okay crosstalk  i know how to make a timer in java its kind of complicated so i just copied and pasted from inaudible  overflow and it would print like the current time when you printed it every time i ran the code or every time you did a loop or whatever and i wanted to print in real time what the timer inaudible  is but i dont think you can do that with this compiler because that would require you to like  like ill give you an example so like maybe i have it  i dont have it saved on here either unbelievable alright i dont want java script lets see there it is this is the exact code that i used so we go and you go into my ide and we say  oh shit so you cant print it in real time in one line you have to do it like that and thats the issue im running into im like oh i would never be able to do this in java so theres gotta be some other way i can do it so if the time is less than  seconds say less than  seconds if the time is less that  seconds or its less than a minute or whatever crosstalk  and you cant like do it in one line see what i mean i dont think theres any way because it just goes line by line crosstalk  no yeah i dont want any package crosstalk  buddhism more like bootyism whens this assignment due im gonna do it later dang it activity c is due at  you you wanna pick me up alright pick me up alright ill walk home can we get an extension on this because its due in three minutes nb                                                i am  im trying to use this table building api and it oh great so it wants me to import some sort of package and i have no idea what that means so even if i tell it to create the class or whatever oh it wants me to clean a whole fucking class holy shit on stack overflow so it prints out stuff like that but i want to because its going to make it way easier and take way less inaudible  do do do do do do do do do do do do oh my god ill just do this fucking assignment later its stupid were doing activity  oh its just a quiz oh god whats question one hey sarah crosstalk  have you ever used table api great yinz are useless whats number two yes yeah and thats not what i want i want that last column lined up perfectly yeah this project is an f youre wired up i dont care whats number three well examine the above method mystery method you need an array and you need the key is that a selection search i think its a selection sort because theres like its its theres nothing its nothing youre just looking at what type of sort it is or a search or whatever is this a linear search i think this is a linear search i think its a linear search but i have no idea that makes a lot of sense cool four lets see inaudible  looks like this numbers three lets see numbers three thatd be one they got to put it up there i think you should dont you have to put it before that told you told you told you told you told you do do do do told you it was one lets see amanda lives like this numbers eight thats going to be a negative one number six lets see what inaudible  may look like this numbers six that will just do the first one so  oh god oh this is a binary search this is index one mmhmm affirmative wait does the array have to be sorted if its a binary search no it doesnt because we just did no because we just did without sorting it yesterday i want question nine is it binary search does it look like this since were search since were searching for six it checks the middle and then it checks the bottom half it keeps cutting it in half until six is found is that how that works is that what a binary search does i have no idea do do do do do do do do do do do do do eight is one yeah thats what im trying to figure out i think its d or its a and then you need to rename it to snippet found index inaudible  oh you dont have to what that is actually insane wait so its three wait for what three is not an answer inaudible  the code is wrong yeah exactly i think its wrong so what do we do oh wait dont you put that in next up there print the index and it made nothing no its just going to do the first half no the fucking system inaudible  print line in the main method no thats not in the main thats the oh put it in oh what the fuck well the answers is wrong not a surprise i guess what well hang on the code is wrong the code is wrong for this question we cant do it for question eight because its doing a thing where we where its not counting the right like thing from yesterday you remember like it would start in the middle but it really isnt a middle because theres like a odd or something numbers and its doing the same thing in this one oh why are we getting all this wrong ass code probably hey this code is wrong here for question eight yep this is question eight and its wrong because the output is none of the answers you actually dont have to look at it check this out check this out yup yeah but the answer is three and three is not an answer whats your return for found index so we we have that code in there and we printed value of found index after the method runs and its giving us three and three is not an answer even though it should be printing one yeah its up here its right there yup its literally doing the same thing as yesterday where its so all of these codes in the book are wrong inaudible  this wrong ass code for our quiz its ridiculous no we should automatically get an a for pointing out all these errors for question a and this thats an a thats right so it gives us crosstalk  that does a binary search of whatever the array thats given here and so i want you to do number six and to this method and so in number six you should get one right because one six is a index one and thats the index you want to return but when we do this code it gives us three which doesnt really make sense i think its like doing the same thing with the code yesterday where it would like since theres not really a middle because theres a odd number no wait no theres like even numbers so it should crosstalk  they dont take in many way i know theyre all from the book thats the funniest part like i know the answer is one and then it does it like this so i dont know why is this code wrong but if were using this i its going to be great i just want to know how i just wonder how to do this table api wood weve congregated all the tas and the professor over here chris is like what the fuck this is alttabing but with your body professional advice from chris do we do negative one or do we do one now oh my god what do we do can we type in an answer oh we get three tries on this yes oh but its one its got to be one how are we supposed to know if its intentionally an error i think im just going to leave it at one because thats what its supposed to output well the other answer choices are binary searching doesnt have to be sorted correct binary doesnt have to be sorted right it does so this isnt sorted is that why what you do have to put in order for a binary search sweet its negative one nine its not supposed to like compile air so its going to be its going to return negative one but why is it returning three wait wait yeah yeah yeah chris its returning three though why is it returning three yeah but if its not sorted it would return negative one according to this answer but its returning three which is the middle element even though there is no well there is a middle you know what i want to go home and eat a burrito dont steal my burrito all right our record should be yeah its on sarah inaudible  nothing looks like this again all right where is the search method oh my god question ten is ridiculous whats twelve smallest first thats what she said and then whats whats the second answer oh smallest first i get it so then whats why does it say first check and third a bubble sorts in array in multiple phases right its not in the book unbelievable just do search bubble thats why i said each successfully each pass successfully swaps the last element if the elements are not in order or is the neighboring its neighboring look at finger  and crosstalk  ohmygod is this going to give us the right answers because this is ridiculous i used to but it sucks i also play dishonored its a great game sorry not interested okay okay wait is this due a because if this is due a im not going to be able to finish it esports are sports you dont watch esports oh okay um what do you get for question  is  just a bubble search because thats what we just answered above i totally think its a bubble search its got to be a bubble search oh my god its a bracket issue controlf proceed boom its exception whats wrong why is snippet wrong do do do do do do do and then voilà its not oh unbelievable all right this is performing a bubble sort its got to be dude its got to be a lets just go back to the question a bubble say sorts the array in multiple phases what how different how much different is it is there like a temporary variable or anything oh yeah there is look up there its a inaudible  its got to be a bubble sort thats a bubble sort no youre a bubble asshole hey is this a bubble sort i have no idea thats a bubble sort wait thats not a bubble sort oh well yeah thats a bubble sort thats got to be a bubble sort its got to be a bubble sort what else is it going to be yeah just tell us what its not inaudible  search i think its its got to be a bubble sort because we just answered the question that asked what a bubble sort was so its got to be a bubble sort by that logic its a bubble sort oh my god why do i have to do this are you serious i dont want to do this right now this is so much work im absolutely positive its a bubble sort and  is merge yeah its got to be i dont know its like a bubble sort but it merges merge its selection ah ah its selection youre right youre right oh  now we got to do this  i have no i have no idea how it  and  yeah how do we know this is even going to work how do you do question ten all right we should want to take an l and get like a b on this im kind of what the fuck i know right its due at nine so we got to stay here and do it yep yeah so lets get it done all right who wants to work on question ten who wants to work on question  who wants to work on question  yeah joelle do you have ten question nine c  is bubble sort dude are we just going to not do three questions because ive got a feel on that so action sort is the last one which is like question  or something bubble sort  is bubble sort  is selection i think why do you think its the other way around or do you not think at all hey what class is this are you serious its searching  is asking you to make arrays or value the array oh oh oh oh for  we can just plugin the mystery and then um no its not so you just got to youre calling it mystery ray or mystery method so print mystery method and then do two in the thing no no no no just print its in the print decease done done done done do do do do done do do do do what why not oh its a import something javainaudible inaudible  here whats the error no print mystery method three like in inaudible  its called mystery method no like the number the number three no what no stop it this fuck numbers isnt even in here so like mystery method numbers numbers oh oh oh oh oh maybe its nevermind this is ridiculous i dont know what the fuck i kind of just want to take the l why did you take the l wait we got three attempts dont we taking the l here we go oh does it show does it show does it show oh god oh no so we have to figure it out searching all right i guess were on the end lets make sure all the shits right  and a  oh fuck zero and a five oh my god it just lost us five points its literally three quarters of our grade so probably got everything else right though holy shit did you get the wrong answer for it oh god yeah its what we did sucks to be you we all right so like three of those we have no idea how to do number  um yeah for three of the questions i have literally more than half this grade greater and less than what greater and less than what this you cant it doesnt work weve tried it it doesnt work so we dont know why yeah like this is bullshit no way did you get it right though yeah so like if we get the three things where its inaudible  is wrong its like i know i cant bring my grade up anymore yeah yeah you fucked up my poll its ridiculous he clicks clear response as the poll fucking launched i mean and i got the answer right oh god that was so i was meant to choke whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa all right  go yes  okay okay all right what  we got selection  wait wait wait wait   youre missing a number for number two   you just do a space    yeah look theres missing this must be seven numbers were missing the six oh yeah whats ten oh here   oh no   fuck wait what what about  yeah we got to redo it you forgot the number yeah whats ten oh my god i dont want to read it really carefully i just want my   six is accurate seven one whats three smallest smaller so it goes inaudible  equals three inaudible  equals  smaller two one six and we got  now youre saying  we forgot the six but we got  minutes to do this quiz have we figured out that one wait theyre all the same why are they all the same ah we have no idea what were doing doing its the same for every single one two oh wait no its not ah shit oh  crosstalk     do do do do do do do do do type sout then controlspace its the greatest thing ever nope its prenamed the addresses done done done done i just want to go home and eat dinner so hungry oh shit way wrong i got a  hell yeah  and number four    look we got your code to work its your code what if its  i thought i was  and you were  all right mic thing goes there time to submit this presentation what is this  let me submit this power point real quick wait wings and coding thats a terrible idea hey chris i have a questiones what are we supposed to do with this dodge r file cause ive tried downloading it and using it in clips and it just i dont know great not downloading it ever again what about this logstext oh my god we are doing activity  today i dont want to i dont want to theres not a problem i just i just wanna know what thats for what about that lets actually find out what that is that looks so amazing define a twodimensional ray of nth data type and name it main ray generate two random numbers between the two and nine inclusive to following inverse of the main ray fill the a b c d e hmm i dont know what you are talking about oh hey your link doesnt work i get  not found yeah thats ted cruz oh thats it all right lets download this bitch download with google why oh the pages work just fine sweet and copy and paste for this link oh man let me save this itsc book no dollars sorry why cant it find words in the damn thing but it should now it can shit now it cant yeah can you do this assignment for me yeah you can im just so tired im so tired im tired of scrawling through this damn textbook why would this be i want to download damnit sign up to download it unbelievable how about i just save as nope that doesnt work either shit did i happen to bring my textbook i did not i should bring that more often yeah so i can look at it in class its a pretty big book and its pretty heavy what chapter is two inaudible  arrays eight god i got like three more chapters to go damn thats really smart so tired that doesnt work website is taking forever to load its pretty bad three other tabs ram i know  mozilla firefox here i come crosstalk  damn mozilla firefox isnt doing much better why is it showing the pages for a split second and then disappearing i just cant handle it i give up i dont want to do this program tonight im so exhausted why not great oh really damn that blows i guess it is an easy program exactly its not easy two rows and three columns you got it hold up wait a minute hold up im confusion lets see the average of the columns are this       yeah its a sample maybe its a typo so it says we need wait a minute it says define a twodimensional ray and give it two rows and three columns right just any rows and columns random and random i dont want to do this im so tired inaudible  i dont know im getting so sleepy i had nine i had eight im super allergic to everything im not if i were allergic to bad grades i wouldnt be alive right now oh wait if i was allergic i wouldnt be alive which means i have good grades your hair or your beard they dont let you have beards thats so ass i would never work at chicfila yeah yeah its awful especially during christmas time christmas this year i had a family knock on my door at am and to sing me a christmas carol this code is giving me brain cancer damn you got me there its not a joke oh what to do so im not getting any user input right or am i lets call this not that how do i call an integer thingy main array equals new array two by three is that how i do it of wait its not new array its new integer lol how to generate a random number i have to do this all over again that sucks balls generate one generate in text equals x generate what is this nevermind i figured it out i forgot you can use integer as mathrandom input is never closed what does that mean crosstalk  why all right how do you fill up an array with loops theres a loop sweet hey andrew your mathrandom generator is a little bit off what yeah i know but its a little bit off when you did it so it going to generate a number between zero and one correct you need to subtract here ill show you so you multiply it by nine and then you subtract two no its times nine minus two plus one or plus one plus two and then it generates between two and nine look thats right i just went through it look the mathrandom works like this if you want to generate a number between yeah plus one minus plus min but it has to be in this case thats why we had the plus one im trying to explain how the code works and everyone is disagreeing with me thats how i did it so andrew andrew there it is this is where brainiacs is   the plus two makes it go from instead of zero to nine it makes it go to two to nine it goes yeah it makes it go from zero to seven to two to nine so its mathrandom times in parenthesis nine minus two closed parenthesis plus one closed parenthesis two times plus two so essentially its seven plus one plus two basically i just used the formula so its easy to remember for this row yeah yeah okay got it its nine minus two plus one plus two and if you want to test it just inaudible  x and y over and over until you get two and nine now we have to print out these arrays then i have to print these arrays and thats it what yes damn that looks so good and now we got to do all this math for it oh yeah try to figure the average of the numbers in each column of the main array storing some variable its going to be a double so we need to make an array for all the averages that we store i know im ready to say it so i can do this tomorrow and then i just dont feel like thinking teddy grahams so andrew out first four loop andrew so out first four loop gets the number of rows the second one gets the number of columns so if we want to calculate the average of the columns we would have to use the second four loop to get a value of whatever of the index and then put it in another array oh my fucking god is x the number of rows or is x the number of columns main array new integer x times y x is your number of columns isnt it i thought x is this y is this way so x is the number of columns then a row goes this way a oh my god i just have to ask fuck so tired im going to figure it out myself i got it m by n so m that matrices damnit thats different no its not maybe well see im just do it print message to see what it does so it goes down and then across so y is the number of columns oh motherfucker main rowlength column plus plus crosstalk  we want to add the average of the column so we want to do the crosstalk  inaudible  main array of i already figured it out fuck mmhmm affirmative okay for length fuck this brain hurts i need a new fucking integer holy shit holy shit a hundred thousand what the shit holy fuck you need to stop that right away make an array it goes stop get it loop loops fuck like that crash someones computer im doing this right oh no chris i cant wrap my head around this i need your help fuck this is so stupid this is fucking bullshit i cant stand this shit im done with math im so fucking tired but that goes through every column i cant wrap my head around this and by yeah i know how to make the array by random numbers but i do not know how to get just the row and put it into a array i guess so i guess what i have is this part at least i copy and pasted this part of my inaudible  four loop here to go to a column or to go through each column but that doesnt work because main not array x is just going to go by the row oh god i cant do this its just too much integer rays has been working for me better integer ray it just worked but then the code uploaded what i needed to upload still i know ive already done that all right so now i just print out that the average array well all i know is thats not yourcrosstalk  is it going to be do tomorrow kay im just so brain dead right now and i got so much i have to do tonight its just i dont know how to go through the column i guess i know how to put everything in its own row and column ive done that its just i want to go through the column bro so this is going through my plan was to go through the column make average array whatever inaudible  by the column spot x is up here is the row that im in the problem is that its not moving to the next row when i do this so i essentially just do this okay lets try this again hey chris what am i doing wrong here what am i doing wrong for this part of my loop im just trying to insert what do you mean what do you mean yeah oh fuck god damnit this is too much just row i just want to throw my laptop across the fucking room right now just so pissed and tired no youre  im  no im  youre   no youre   no hes always been   youre   fate  why is this so ifing were all in this together  we dont want to know how much sugar you have in that bag  ha ha its a little late for that oh balls  i really fucked up im just kidding there are a lot of big words in here  and then turn it left  and left  whats that laughs well dont know what it is but it tastes good  ha ha  i got the two layers right now  all right  all right yall lets knock out this activity  you said not to touch it and i touched it what are you gonna do about it  just gonna drink it thats what im gonna do what have you been washing it in oh no  i havent started assignment three  i have been so busy this week its been its been ha ha ha  whats up dun dun duuuunnnn thats gross  ha ha ha im not  the snowsberry tastes like snowsberry  no hey sarah what time are your office hours starting tomorrow do you want to do the entire assignment three with me as comedy central the snowberries taste like snowberries  yeah i got some oxies  no crosstalk  inaudible   i do  whenever i have surgery laughs and ive had a lot of those  i had to when i had my shoulder surgery i couldnt like stand not taking it like i had to i couldnt stand it i was in so much pain like fuck it ill stay on it for three days and then im gonna go off  did they all right  ibuprofen makes my stomach hurt if i take it too often  crosstalk  can i get a crosstalk  boneless pizza  just let it all out cry  ive got benadryl in my car  its zyrtec it just helps clear him up that better be cleared zyrtec laughter shes checking  little does she know he actually just took acid  hey guess what  chicken butt  import have dot utility dot astros thing dot semicolon  dot i hate my life forward slash did i do this right slash slash camis public static void  disaster dun dun dun duuunnnn  no  crosstalk  scanner input equal to  spinner  system dot m  ahhh hey quit crying i dont want any emotions going around when im trying to code laughter  a suicide booth  laughs the purple box  you cant buy suppressants from walmart unless you have to be   ha ha he would know this how oh i was like what what did you do the activity on do you not have a valid license  no thats bullshit  well its still bullshit its   well at least  you can either give it over the phone or in person  and a bouncy ball to keep you entertained while we steal all your information  can i get a boneless pizza please boneless pizza  i want a boneless pizza  a boneless pizza laughs did someone say boneless pizza how many rows do you want the array to be  crosstalk  oh no id be fucking around with people the whole time  sir are you have an emergency yes sorry what did you say yes did you say no laughter  crosstalk  did you say no yes  no call max did you say turn on the lights  yes  hey guys how do you say no without saying no  yesn  nont laughs  noes no its yesn  yesn  now how did you do it for the timing  hey have you told your parents that your gay yet answer the question  okay youre gay no im just kidding  crosstalk  my favorite fifth grade joke was have you seen the clown that hides from gay people and im like no and then you just laugh at people its funny i dont know alright  ha ha ha yes  crosstalk  im a little worried where has this been you want a stick of meat laughs  spicy spicy hey i know something that is sweet and salty crosstalk  inaudible  i feel terrible because we have two women in here there going stop stopped why  but there are straight people who are sensitive too  yeah you choose what you get offended by  crosstalk  there are no lines laughs  crosstalk i was watching that have you guys heard of um i cant remember his name but its that stand up comedian that stutters he got hit by a softball in the throat and he stutters  crosstalk  its like eric lynch or something like that  okay well this guy is really funny and hes like he says he has like a speech impediment so hes like yeah im a stand up comedian so if you dont laugh at people with disabilities youre an asshole or something like that i thought it was really funny  ha ha  wait how do i do this that is a proper name  equalscrosstalk  salt during number b  all right lets see if this works oh wait fuck that was actually really great because we were all just like the fuck  i dont vape i dont know this  hey chris oh wait i figured it out  are you sure  dove really for men or for women it is better  or do you do yourself a favor and take a cold shower  oh i did it boys lets just stop there  oh my freaking god we have to make it into a method unbelievable  thats what she said  so good  ahh no laughter  i feel so bad crosstalk  aw dude have you seen that video where the guy like takes the aluminum foil and stuffs it with like ths of weed and just like put it in the air compressor thing and they just shoot in their car  its awesome they hot box their car in like two seconds  quarter three quarterwhat ever i dont know it was a lot of weed it was a shit ton  its a one fourth hey man can i get a fourth of weed dude i order mine from the dark red so i dont have to get shot  well im sorry about your hair color  its kinda like black into gray into some weird blue  sarah sarah what the heck man  do you not care about us  everyone look at their screens dont even look at her  we cant keep a straight face we dont know what we are doing  oh dammit hey guys how do i make a method  carefully  i already did that  oh sweet i did it laughter  so if im like returning  gasp i figured it out thank you for telling me the answer public say int can you say that one more time im sorry public say int  um so yeah public say int and then parenthesis or  no i cant do that and then do i put a space here thats right  perimeters should be x and y okay x comma y  yeah okay  no i have that teacher now  um my stat professor is this asian lady who doesnt speak english and she so it was great  no shes korean kims are korean arent they  kims are usually korean arent they  yeah shes korean yeah she doesnt speak any english its really bad but i got a  on our first exam and the class average was a  and then randomly she just changed my grade to  today so im like sweet thanks  stats sucks dude i hate it oh are you in algebra  waltons been pretty good pretty solid we had an exam today and i think i either got a  or  on it so well see  yeah cause there was like  questions no like  questions on there that arent they great  so we do the lab before the lab starts  yeah his office hours are his lab hours  no no were in his yeah we have been in there before  what weve been in this class what and youve missed us how many times  aw man i dont know what to name my parameters parameters  what do you want dammit mother fucker  buh ugh i dont know what im doing  freaking im such a moron  what else is new man all right thats more like it  you know im not liking your presence all that much right now  you know i dont appreciate the hostility right now crosstalk  i know you ruined it you ruined it so  what do i do jesus input can not be resolved oh yeah thats right lol  i mean the only weirder thing is to do this and to go over return r r cant be resolved to a variable excellent work  do do do suck his nuts oh i really shouldnt be saying that laughs  all right how do i return an array  return the name of it i guess  so like  im on a boat  i have one have two youre dead  what  its like pringles you can never have just one  oh my gosh i got a card hey why am i getting this error right here  yeah it is thats what i did up there  wait i am so confused right now  wait what did i do up here  how did this work up here no it did maybe wait how did i do this wait im so confused whats activia  its kinda like this how did i do this i dont know oh i totally forgot this thing right here  i wanna make that the i have that there  im just gonna copy and paste it here i made like i got like half way through the program and i realized oh i got to put this in a method so that was fun crosstalk   a game  yeah laughs  but isaiah if we do that youll have to be able to pin it without him realizing  laughs that sounds like what kids do to girls in middle school the girls they like www you had some crushes on you  wait back up why do you pepper on a pizza  with pineapple oh i thought you were talking about crushed black pepper i was like why are you putting black pepper on a pizza  i actually think i would eat that  if its like a peperoni sausage meat ham meat lovers pizza i dont think that black pepper would be too bad  i like either green peppers red peppers onions with the sausage all right yall i made me method now i dont know how to do this  all right how do i return how do i like so i made a method that returns and array so how do i get it  no im so confused on how to do this  the return type is an array  yeah ive typed in return array   yeah how do you do that exactly  im returning the  i think i did so thats the im returning that array like i mean the double array like i want to return that to here and print it so do i just do array one  is that how that works  which is r  so how do you  and r cant reset to a variable  printing out that array yeah yeah ohhhh  i got it i got it  its to the point where  yeah dammit mother  the main hey chris i need you to explain what im doing here ive confused myself  so i want to return the array that i made in here back to my main method and i dont know how to do it like i made my method and int with array with two dimensions  and that this is all correct this prints it i just want to return it back to the main method and i dont know how to do it  and then i get an error  so i just dont even need that in there  he needs help so were not passing through the main method where the so thats what that is for is passing it from the main method into that  mmhmm affirmative so you just put  and  in here as well or  and then the x and y is somewhere in here that  okay i get it easy thank you  just bleach it three one two three one why why why this is the color that everyone wants  just do it for your graduation  ugh my hair is beautiful you will never get to this  no you didnt do you have picture evidence  crosstalk  then it looks like it didnt happen  damn we got the average for the row but now we have to get the average for the damn array  thats what im using  wait it is wait what activity  what activity am i looking at  wasnt it im very far i just need to do one more method  always  no it wasnt um  activity   activity  only did the rows  activity  so  yes i asked collectively though  well at least until tonight  i have a question on it  i have a question  how do i code okay but actually my question is i am trying to use activity  from yesterday and this is when we took the average of the rows and what not okay then how do i make it easier  is there like a method for making i honestly used to have a buzz cut  nope  holy shit i used to have a big dick noah believes that okay this is not working for me public static one two three lets go army  you look so sad in that photo like ive made a tremendous mistake with my life  what  a type of ant how about you fuck yourself  gasp i gotta do something i dont know what i did though how did i do that  so do i choose how much i put in to it i dont know how to do that its a miracle ive gotten this far this was just taken from  i know ive been cutting as i cause then he also gave us the fucked up one where its   do you know how to so i want to use where is it i want to use array up here the array that i had up here  and pass it through this so i type in array here i get these fricking errors like all over the place and uh yeah i dont know  but like its named in my main method  yeah thats what i did  but like thats exactly what i did i just made it into a variable array and called it array  so and now i just want to use it in here  it is static so okay  professor i dont know how to do this  no i know how to do the second part  i need to figure out i know how to calculate the average of stuff im just having trouble with the method calling so like i have it called average  the second part of the first question  so like we have the public static double average and i want to put my array through it and i named it up here array from what i made it my original method here called array and whatever that method was and i posted it like that but now its giving me an error that it wants me to rename brackets and stuff and i dont know what to do  sure you can  because im lonely and i like to sit in the corner  well its only there and  and then its totally fine  does it what  um it should not get an input or it needs my array to do it  yeah  uh arr  it should be right there no this creates the array and has a user input  okay  yes  okay yes but why do i have these bracket errors um  its only when i type in something to the parameters is when it gives me the error so you can delete and the bracket and the two braces wont give me an error  oh there we go yay i need a scanner dude the hash browns at chick fila this morning were so fucking good  and the total equals  a r r  wait did we finish part one  sweet  so  i am confusion  why is that wrong im so fucking pissed right now  why is plus equals this makes no fucking sense no this isnt right oh my fucking god  i cant get plus equals to worked youve given up  im getting a very strange error  when im doing when im adding in a term to my total it says that i cannot do plus equals and i dont know why  is this not getting the value at whatever that is  right there  so the term doesnt is this not getting a term from the array  oh thats right so i need to do it outside of the loop  this is so fucking stupid  int term equals zero  four five  nine one two four  cool i did the entire assignment boys  look chris im an expert  we already turned it off didnt we   everywhere  hack that email jesus has arrived  here i changed his name to what it should be  can i get my pizza boneless  inmate   say our numbers im inmate  what inmate are you what are you all doing for good friday you all want to get to class  you all want to get really drunk friday night or my apartment or anyones apartment do you live at heather ridge im in heather ridge right behind the harris theater  time to get drunk this weekend boys on this friday for good friday im assuming everyone here is  right so you cant buy anything you cant get drunk   damn i feel so old  hes    something right i dont want to generate five thats so dumb i want to other the five ones up and down its so weird  this is how i think do re mi do re mi do re fuck me  hey whoa whoa children  yes its one of my favorite words it is my favorite word  its so versatile  you can use it anytime bad good fuck yeah fuck no  any fucking situation fucking kind of works  theres emphasis  use it as a literal word i was fucking  you can go fuck man i was fucking so many fucking bitches that  i dont know theres more fucks you could use  no you  no i am thats the sad part  saturday is the day  im working until     i told them i couldnt work after   must be nice must be nice  maybe we could just do it thursday instead just bring our alcohol in class  professor if youre listening to this would you care to join us  or just get a bottle of windex and some blue gatorade  put some bleach and just put water in it  you drink the bleach clean it with bleach and then drink the bleach bleach is really healthy for you it kills all your germs out  hey we should chris we should invite chris and sarah  im looking at these zeros   if you want  hey sarah what are you doing this friday or we could be the pregame  were going to try and get jeff cote to come but well see  he seems like a christian man that doesnt like to partake  in the alcoholic  how are we supposed to start this because the writing on there is too small i need to know for me i dont feel like moving theyre behind  how do you generate a random number from zero to nine zero to eight  oh my god   wow that worked way better than i expected it so ive got my column generator  thats right  why do you type like not an old lady its so much better  these dang gone computer machinery things theyre so complicated  why cant i just put my punch card in the machine and have it output the calculations ive got seven billion discord notifications what is going on stop it stop it stop it  the xy  fair enough yeah  thats pretty pointless  now i got to eat  my brain hurts  oh shit thats not nice  i have half a brain  i need one brain cell  you made it this far  thats a hard working cell  yeah dude i just take creatine every morning i just get a funnel ill put some creatine in there and it pumps out brain all day  thats how my other cells died they couldnt handle it  but hes like brain dead  what the hell did you just do bag of dicks  i dont want one of those  hey mr jeff cote  i know how to generate a random column put the one in but i cant import my rows from my other ring that loops putting a zero in each position i cant do that here because row is specifically for here  do i just do another loop to put it in rows this is just testing to see if the actually works im going to fix it to make sure it only puts it in certain rows  is it i okay  should i put five ones in there vertically  that one its not showing up what whoa whoa great  it does  thats cool  what weve got a major dilemma here  weve got a major dilemma we got a shit load of ones  i am so lazy  he hasnt even done his assignment  yes  ive never had a watermelon flavor  let me get one of those  hmmmhmm affirmative  damn those are tasty  i appreciate your generosity  im already there send me the address im walking there  i guess well find that out tomorrow  ive got a loser so far  he almost won he was one one way  im going to fix it  professor i have a question  so ive generated the slot machine to drain the five ones but i dont know how to increment it   where should my press enter go in this loop should it go just before this right here  so its after you print the actual aray but before you can go to the next line is just your formatting because were actually printing out a space  press enter  should i just make it a string dot next then they just press enter  oh its next line   then that should do it press enter well its doing that  that should solve at least one line prints five times  because its inside this loop  so it needs to come  this is printing the aray the aray is defaulting to zeros so you dont need to put anything in the aray at all  this just prints it when you make a five by nine two dimensional aray it just fills it with zeros  this is printing each of the zeros  so what is the display for this program right here is printing this  okay that makes sense  i have no idea what she said to me hey im wired up  can i just make a wild loop that makes this way easier  while your counters less than five just keep pressing enter  this sucks  i dont know what im doing  why not just make five arrays and then  i can just make five arrays  it just shows plus enter  oh my god thats just cheating  let me see that wait dude you have it so easy look  do not rely right now  oops thats not the main aray  wow that was so easy i just fixed it for you  god it took two lines  just say you lose every time because the probability is so low its literally impossible lets do that exit form before we forget  i have done it like two days after class sometimes  you did it again  just do it outside  just do it outside the loop  what interesting concept did you learn today gambling is bad  bang bang bang  we should just turn that in  i feel positive in our neutral  change war war never changes  what yeah its done  oh andrew you know what you can do you can do a random number generator from zero to  make the number two the winning number one in  chance to say you won    its almost impossible to win  but how do we make it align would i just google how to check if columns an aray this is impossibrew  oh you know what you can do you can make one two three four five six seven hey andrew you can make nine aray i know im sorry  you can make nine different arrays each of them with the winning  i know isnt that great you can make nine arrays each with the winning ones and then know check and see if any of the arrays contains the same values that would work if it doesnt then say you lose  suck my butt  creatively vulgar  dude im probably outline of research youve got all these productive students talking then youve just got me going  jargon where did chris go  all right who wants to be productive tomorrow exactly we can just do this tomorrow  at my old university at unca i had a philosophy professor who was extremely gender neutral and all about that having on your papers and not saying sexist words i guess she said we couldnt use the word mankind we had an argument for like  minutes about the definition of mankind  stop it hey were still miced up  oh my god  hey that looks really good  doesnt look really good never mind its fucked up  its fucked up  why is it yellow why is it red why are numbers red the one two three four five six seven eight nine       you can do that can i make mine rainbow alternate the colors thatd be so cool is that how i change my personality right click personality  thatd be so cool if thats how that worked all right id rather talk about what were doing friday than do this code right now wow thats a fat cat  mine id too i reinstalled it  the sum of a column  you sum of a column  i love my dad did that to me when i was a kid i was like shit watch your fucking language son but dad you just said it i dont fucking care i can say what the fuck i want because im an adult blah blah blah  what activity is that oh god i think we did an activity for that i gave it some cocaine  close enough  its a heat stick  potatoes because my people had the potato famine once upon a time  i love scallions  because youre ginger  hes ginger curry  i dont know anybody that hates fried chicken except for losers  if you dont like fried chicken youre a waste of oxygen  no its not what you think im being not serious okay im not not being not serious so that means im being serious  wait this is due in four minutes oh god should i just turn in what i have that just speaks too deeply to me  just say you lose yee master ha ha  what was the interesting concept you learned today msk would have been better than writing on the white board  i dont know how to addiction a column so im just going to say you lose every time whats up get yours done you know this is when you just chuck it out the window  it looks like mines already been chucked out the window a couple times  i was on my skateboard and the laptop just lands on the fucking ground  it works though its a fucking tank until its not a tank  until it just shits itself and dies  oh god its due time to turn them in activity java choose file ive got less than  seconds go go go submit boom i skirted on that assignment  no were not finished with the code but were finished with this recorder ,oh  god  oh  god  actually  ridiculous  oh  boy  public  static  void  main  god  use  everything  sorry  dont  understand  okay  done  like  dont  know

yes okay okay do this activity with the sum and inaudible  this activity you will write a program that prompts you use your two inter inaudible  okay so its just four different methods all right so what do you want to do first do you want to write the if statements and then we can write the functions later or do you want to write the functions first okay so just write down things can you please enter the length of your sides well put that in the  so well do if statements oh yeah well wed enter the shape first well the thing is that these all have different different i guess dimensions so to measure the area of a square you would just need one side for a rectangle you need a length and a width for a triangle you need the base and the height and then for a circle you need the radius okay so i wrote the methods and then all we need to do is we need to make if statements to check what they use our inputs what the shape is and youve got all the  each of these methods i guess corresponds to a shape so if they pick square we do square we ask for the length and then we do square area on whatever length they give right so yeah and i think a good way to do the variables i guess a simpler way would just be like x y and z because the most were going to give is  the most parameters were going to pass is two so so i guess were going to just do three groups here again what do you mean for the secondcrosstalk  is that part two oh i havent read that yet ill read it later well just lets just do this first did you read the chapter or oh yeah youre talking about assignment two right okay mmhmm affirmative the next friday yeah who no i mean i know where her  her office is on the  floor so do you kind of understand whats going on what okay the exclusion workshops yeah i did i went on monday that was really boring i did not enjoy it at all no dude i got out of that that was insane i didnt yeah i got it with the really social people thats how you win then you dont have to do anything and you just let them do everything inaudible  triangle pretty much yeah well i mean its all part of one program its just decluttering your main method because rather than for each of these putting the calculations for square rectangle triangle et cetera we can just do methods and then you see how nice this looks like area equals square area of x and then if you  so whenever youre writing huge programs you can look and you can say okay square area of x so its obviously a function and then you can go find square area of x and see exactly what it does rather than having like so how long has this program  lines so rather than our main method being  lines or i guess itd be  because we subtract the headers its only what like  lines so it just kind of  it saves a lot of space then y equals input of next int as well and then if we do area equals and ive already made the function triangle area x and then y and then were done oh then we have circle too do you understand how methods work yeah like here ill show you let me call them so now we have x equals input that next in which were treating as the radius so i have a function that is circle area and it returns a double and it takes the  it takes a double called radius so whenever we call it we just do circle area and then so like autopopulates radius yeah so we can just pass x and now when it gets  now whenever this is run it basically in this function this function runs and it basically says radius is equal to x because thats what we pass to it and then it returns area so actually need to do area equals circle area and then itll store whatever value the function returns into our area variable and can you kind of see what im going to  at the very end on the return area im in the system dot out the whatever area yeah so then we can just at the end print f right so we can run this and it says we have to  that they should be able to enter it in upper case lower case or mixed i did two lower case and then so you just go like shape oh thats not what we were supposed to do so now enter strat sideline oh its your inaudible  okay nevermind aha its here cool so what happened here i put parentheses d which is an integer and we need to change it to f and then if we do this we put the  in front of it we can just round it to two decimals yeah and then were done with that what is this by writing a method which checks whether an integer number is even or odd the method gets an integer number as a parameter and reruns the result to the main method returns i think thats what they meant to say so yeah how do you think how would we do that yeah so if its zero its even if its yeah huh sorry which if statement the if statement for what for i dont know what youre saying what youre talking about oh yeah yeah well yeah were just going to have a method and then its going to be if x or our number mod zero is equal to zero its going to return even and then if its not its going to return odd i mean we could have it return an integer and we could have it return zero for even and one for odd and then we get an if statement here which is what i kind of thought you were talking about but yeah i guess we should make a string  for odd and then we can call  what do you want to name them after the method that were going to use well do num check make it real nice num check so what im going to do is im going to do even or odd equals num check and then were going to check x okay so how would wecrosstalk  well what do we what is even or odd its a string yeah so youre going to have it return a string right and then or what did i call it num check and then what would this take in what is x going to be exactly and what do you want to call it we just call it num we can call it anything it doesnt matter and then what is the inside going to look like so we have to have our if statement right so then if num mod zero equals zero then what does this mean exactly yeah so we can return how would this work i wonder if we could do this just return a literal string even oh yeah it does and then so else  if the modulus isnt zero we know that its going to be odd so we can just go ahead and return odd yeah i think so yeah and then we should just print that out dot print f and then well do a new line because we used  yeah we used print f up there so  or wait no were good i think well do that well do that well do three lines or two so print f the number  actually what we could do here since were using print f instead of declaring even or odd we could just put in here num check of x why is it giving an error wait what is x oh okay so now well see if this works then enter an integer  through  and it should say  wait what oh wait oh wait hold on im confused mmhmm affirmative could we  its saying that were dividing by zero oh no its mod two i put mod zero on accident cool and then we can try it with a  so well do triangle this one to our base is  and our head is one it should be  yeah then an integer will do with  and then its even i think thats it right okay do you want me to email this to you oh yeah oh so what do you go home and then you read the book and then you do these the activities what about the activity yeah no the activity oh do you prefer to do it that way yeah pretty much i mean not the one from tuesday that one was prettycrosstalk  was that in the book did you finish it oh okay no not really i know a lot of it but like methods i dont really i understand how methods work but im kind of unsure about modifiers i know the basic modifiers like public static et cetera and stuff like that because ill  thats just object oriented stuff butcrosstalk  yeah well theyre yeah c sharp and java are basically the same language huh oh like public static private yeah yeah the second computer science class the second intro class thats more of the stuff that im not sure of and then ill probably read the book but right now i dont really look much stuff up what do you mean intro to computer science  so im taking that over the summer its an  am to  pm class so its very long theres also an  to  in the second term if you want to take that one monday wednesday friday pretty insane yeah so theres all these oh theres a ton of them during the fall but theres only two over the summer nice oh and its  to  and then this one is  to  but its a lab and class so your class is from  to  and then your lab is from  to  its just more java so like version control i dont know thats github or git or what or if thats some sort of built in java version control debuggers class design aggregation and association exception handling generic and abstract types inheritance polymorphism interfaces and abstract classes so basically just a bunch of object oriented stuff oh yeah i forgot about that are you doing the extra credit not this one obviously but the other one yeah no im not going to do it no i have a pretty good grade i feel like i can get through with an a unless the next lab tests is as bad as the last one i think ill be fine what does this mean the options that best describe your experience today is this is about me or you receiving responding valuing organizing and characterizing i guess yeah all right yeah i think so too we dont have to sit here for the end the rest of the class he said right yeah i didnt i did not no i dont think it says that you need to submit one but yeah silence inaudible  i think so the lights on so this what it is so just a random number of array dot length and then we just  because if were on in the middle of the array we can get a number that we have reassigned so its like we getting a lot of the same numbers oh yeah yeah i have it i printed it yeah i printed twice yeah so its  oh yeah so this is the first yeah but isnt that what i am doing so its reassigning its not here because if we get up to here from this index to five in this array we could pick a number that we have already assigned up here so we dont even  i dont really know how to explain it because i know that we could do it by  yeah so we are not keeping all the original numbers  yeah to what to swap them okay okay so is this  yeah what is the issue yeah well because the random number can generate the same random number twice right so wont this mean that some of these would remain unchanged from the initial and then its like index minus one what if we get index zero though should we  yeah yeah okay so wouldnt we solve the same issue we wouldnt because we are changing the main array we are not making a new array right or is that all right lets say we changed this index so index of six and it became seven if the random number generates this six that would be like six minus one we could print six twice so wouldnt we still run into the same issue despite having crosstalk  yeah yeah yeah i am still a little confused because we are doing a random index so how can we get consistency do you mean maybe if we yeah could you write it on here just whatever it was you can just write numbers yeah yeah okay so you would  okay can you undo that one more time yeah yeah it is a zero to four yeah so c yeah because we are on iteration one which is this so then one equals one and one this would be two and one so two and one so this would be c so we swapped the initial array oh i see what youre saying yeah so b and c yeah yeah yeah so this would be a yeah because that stays constant so then this would be c how does it change these two so array index one array index two so this would be b oh yeah yeah yeah one and then its two so we are swapping array one with array two oh we are swapping them oh okay i see what you are saying so this would be b this would be a okay yeah yeah oh i see what you are saying yeah it will go there you are moving them okay i see what you are saying now okay it is yes okay thank you well we werent i wasnt swapping them i was just straight up assigning but what shes saying is that i need to set this index you pull to this and then  i actually need to save no e yeahinaudible  oh i see what shes saying thats pretty dumb and then we are going to set name array of i equal to ten okay i think this is what she wants and then if we run this that should give a lot more consistent results yeah that works does that make sense yeah because were swapping them rather than just assigning yeah no so here you are taking the first half of your source array what do you mean oh for e sorry kind of you doing this so this is how she explained it but that is not very good lets say you have your source array you are on index one you are going to generate a random index like what say you generate index three which is nine you are going to swap them so this is going to become nine and this is going to become one does that make sense inaudible  sorry so we get a random number now our random number is our index sorry do you want me to unplug it for you are you sure youre going dont break the computer yeah yeah yeah its the like main thing i will hold it i will hold it like this i do not think its stuck are we done okay hold on do you want me to email this to you okay no you could probably just take it off if you want nice okay yeah no not yet b oh e can we get this off   yeah  oh my god this is easy are you serious inaudible  dude no i havent looked at it yet crosstalk  i guess wait sorry exactly what do you mean if its going to two like as an example no but you need to declare the inaudible  right i thought they said to find a twodimensional array generate two random numbers between two and nine to define the dimensions yeah oh yeah yeah i dont do that you could do that or you could define a separate integer so like in rows equals inaudible  random thats how i did it its up to you though either way will work like to declare the dimensions you need to use random numbers so you could either put them directly into the definition or you could just use two integers to declare like rows and columns is it yeah you just add up all the columns you add up all the numbers in the columns and then you just divide them by the total number of rows yeah so crosstalk  yeah that was right oh so you figured average use an array dont use that like this this is mine we have an average array and then weve got the average index so were going to keep track of what index were on in the average this is just to add up the total and then were just going to divide this by the length how many rows there are this is the index of the maximum average and then this is the index or not the index this is the value of the average thats the maximum because in the last part we have to co yeah does that make sense yeah you can just scroll sorry like move you can do it yeah average average index this is just calculating the average because up here i do the total so i calculate the total of every index crosstalk  for that youre consistently calculating it over and over so you need to move that outside crosstalk  both of those no you leave the average actually im sorry youre doing it right you want to calculate the yeah you want to calculate the total and then outside you can get the average  how is it doing while she was talking i did mine like this because you dont need to loop through all of it because youre looping through the columns as well so youre looping through each individual column all you need is the first you dont need these crosstalk  for the caller because whenever you look at it you want a loop and you want one here and you want to change one thing here one thing here one thing here one thing here one thing here so you want to change one thing in every row so you want to loop through it doesnt hurt youre using an online id i just wanted to download the clips oh understandable okay so you want to generate  randomly so what does this piece represent what goes here like what number yeah so thats the index of the column that youre changing through once so you did it here yeah wait oh you have to im sorry to print i did this i will just make a method like this to print here alright because otherwise youll have to make a variable for column and then youll have to type each one you can do it it will be really easy so like youd make it in tokyo and youd call it the incolumn counter you write column and then every time at the end of the slip you would enter the contract column over here actually im not sure if the word is crosstalk  inaudible  yeah i think you should make a prevary  method yeah everything is correct you have it right everything is right its just printing the array so youre generating all the ones that you need cant stay here all night youre almost done like you really are what are you confused about yeah so the only issue is that youre not printing the array properly so just make a new method and call it print array well how would you print an array you would just lift your every element and then print there right like these but this is for printing my array this isnt for actually generating the numbers for generating the numbers im going to crosstalk  go through the rows but then for printing the arrays i would do the rows and the columns is it okay i did it like this to check so i checked it like this so what i did is that i stored the indexes of where the ones are and then i just compared them since the orders and xs are equal then theyre in order is that okay yeah because it works i just wanted to know inaudible  okay all right thank you why didnt you remove what you had already its okay inaudible  so what youre trying to do when youre parsing an array you dont need to put those yeah this is the print to your functions right im sorry what youre doing is that youre trying to print the array and do the random number at the same time so dont do that so you use the printer a function and then you have one thats generating a random number howre you doing i did the search differently so how did you do that what were doing is that for each row were generating a random column from zero to how many columns we have so if we just store that random number into a variable we have the index and the columns lets say that this is index  thats index  thats index  thats index  thats index  right so if we store the indexes of the ones into a  so like you see this is where i print the index so the first born in the first row is at index  so zero column  row  column zero row  column  row  column  etc you see what i mean exactly so we can then just compare indexes of i to indexes of i   and then if any of those arent equal then we can just return that they didnt win and it works too because if you felt here like this and you inaudible  again we hopefully inaudible  there see you could do it like that if you want how did she explain it yeah i have no idea searching through the columns so its like going through the columns like one by one and then checking whether its all equal to one definitely the way that i did it or the way that she did it you have a what you dont have a class where do you work its all right yeah youre gone for lunch okay sounds good,yes  okay  okay  activity

computer  science  class  second  intro  class  thats  stuff  im  sure  ill  probably  read  book  right  dont  really  look  much  stuff  mean  intro  computer  science  im  taking  summer  pm  class

think  dont  sit  end  rest  class  said  right  yeah  didnt  dont  think  say  need  submit  one  yeah  silence  think  light  random  number  array  dot  length  middle  array  get  number  reassigned  like  getting  lot  number  oh  yeah  yeah  printed  yeah  printed  twice  yeah  oh  yeah  first  yeah  isnt  reassigning  get  index  five  array  could  pick  number  already  assigned  dont  even  dont  really  know  explain  know  could  yeah  keeping  original  number  yeah  swap  okay  okay  yeah  issue  yeah  well  random  number  generate  random  number  twice  right  wont  mean  would  remain  unchanged  initial  like  index  minus  one  get  index  zero  though  yeah  yeah  okay  wouldnt  solve  issue  wouldnt  changing  main  array  making  new  array  right  right  let  say  changed  index  index  six  became  seven  random  number  generates  six  would  like  six  minus  one  could  print  six  twice  wouldnt  still  run  issue  despite  yeah  yeah  yeah  still  little  confused  random  index  get  consistency  mean  maybe  yeah  could  write  whatever  write  number  yeah  yeah  okay  would  okay  undo  one  time  yeah  yeah  zero  four  yeah  c  yeah  iteration  one  one  equal  one  one  would  two  one  two  one  would  c  swapped  initial  array  oh  see  youre  saying  yeah  b  c  yeah  yeah  yeah  would  yeah  stay  constant  would  c  change  two  array  index  one  array  index  two  would  b  oh  yeah  yeah  yeah  one  two  swapping  array  one  array  two  oh  swapping  oh  okay  see  saying  would  b  would  okay  yeah  yeah  oh  see  saying  yeah  go  moving  okay  see  saying  okay  yes  okay  thank  well  werent  wasnt  swapping  straight  assigning  shes  saying  need  set  index  pull  actually  need  save  e  yeahinaudible  oh  see  shes  saying  thats  pretty  dumb  going  set  name  array  equal  ten  okay  think  want  run  give  lot  consistent  result  yeah  work  make  sense  yeah  swapping  rather  assigning  yeah  taking  first  half  source  array  mean  oh  e  sorry  kind  explained  good  let  say  source  array  index  one  going  generate  random  index  like  say  generate  index  three  nine  going  swap  going  become  nine  going  become  one  make  sense  sorry  get  random  number  random  number  index  sorry  want  unplug  sure  youre  going  dont  break  computer  yeah  yeah  yeah  like  main  thing  hold  hold  like  think  stuck  done  okay  hold  want  email  okay  could  probably  take  want  nice  okay  yeah  yet  b  oh  e  get  yeah  oh  god  easy  serious  dude  havent  looked  yet  guess  wait  sorry  exactly  mean  going  two  like  example  need  declare  right  thought  said  find  twodimensional  array  generate  two  random  number  two  nine  define  dimension  yeah  oh  yeah  yeah  dont  could  could  define  separate  integer  like  row  equal  random  thats  though  either  way  work  like  declare  dimension  need  use  random  number  could  either  put  directly  definition  could  use  two  integer  declare  like  row  column  yeah  add  column  add  number  column  divide  total  number  row  yeah  yeah  right  oh  figured  average  use  array  dont  use  like  mine  average  array  weve  got  average  index  going  keep  track  index  average  add  total  going  divide  length  many  row  index  maximum  average  index  index  value  average  thats  maximum  last  part  co  yeah  make  sense  yeah  scroll  sorry  like  move  yeah  average  average  index  calculating  average  total  calculate  total  every  index  youre  consistently  calculating  need  move  outside  leave  average  actually  im  sorry  youre  right  want  calculate  yeah  want  calculate  total  outside  get  average  talking  mine  like  dont  need  loop  youre  looping  column  well  youre  looping  individual  column  need  first  dont  need  caller  whenever  look  want  loop  want  one  want  change  one  thing  one  thing  one  thing  one  thing  one  thing  want  change  one  thing  every  row  want  loop  doesnt  hurt  youre  using  online  id  wanted  download  clip  oh  understandable  okay  want  generate  randomly  piece  represent  go  like  number  yeah  thats  index  column  youre  changing  yeah  wait  oh  im  sorry  print  make  method  like  print  alright  otherwise  youll  make  variable  column  youll  type  one  really  easy  like  youd  make  tokyo  youd  call  incolumn  counter  write  column  every  time  end  slip  would  enter  contract  column  actually  im  sure  word  yeah  think  make  prevary  method  yeah  everything  correct  right  everything  right  printing  array  youre  generating  one  need  cant  stay  night  youre  almost  done  like  really  confused  yeah  issue  youre  printing  array  properly  make  new  method  call  print  array  well  would  print  array  would  lift  every  element  print  right  like  printing  array  isnt  actually  generating  number  generating  number  im  going  go  row  printing  array  would  row  column  okay  like  check  checked  like  stored  index  one  compared  since  order  x  equal  theyre  order  okay  yeah  work  wanted  know  okay  right  thank  didnt  remove  already  okay  youre  trying  youre  parsing  array  dont  need  put  yeah  print  function  right  im  sorry  youre  youre  trying  print  array  random  number  time  dont  use  printer  function  one  thats  generating  random  number  howre  search  differently  row  generating  random  column  zero  many  column  store  random  number  variable  index  column  let  say  index  thats  index  thats  index  thats  index  thats  index  right  store  index  one  like  see  print  index  first  born  first  row  index  zero  column  row  column  zero  row  column  row  column  etc  see  mean  exactly  compare  index  index  arent  equal  return  didnt  win  work  felt  like  hopefully  see  could  like  want  explain  yeah  idea  searching  column  like  going  column  like  one  one  checking  whether  equal  one  definitely  way  way  dont  class  work  right  yeah  youre  gone  lunch  okay  sound  good,0.0820342427356816,1
inaudible  marco lets try the functions first and then we could just input the inputs or no i was just saying it like the flow chart where its like enter the length of your sides and thencrosstalk  is it or  i thought it was supposed to be like figure it out oh yeah nevermind sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah and for the second program for  i mean i guess problem  is basically just checking just using a  what is it a remainder like a modulus to check if its like acrosstalk  yeah part two i kind of just been working on the assignment hopefully i can get it finished by the time i get home that way i dont have to worry about it yeah that way i can just start like really study for this test thats coming up in two weeks they said the lab test is going to be next friday or was it going to be the friday after that all right i have to start practicing with the examples i have inaudible  and start asking questions when they get back on monday do you have you met her  with her with in her office marcin no oh i really do im just  eh no i was thinking about something else what did you do for the did you have to go to that thing we had to do for  yeah how did you feel about that i can imagine you just acting out i got into it i did pretty well at it i guess my group was really into it there was a lot of people that were acting like animals and i was like dang yeah so methods is just making this small programs inside your program yeah yeah when are they called have you put that in yet yes but you named it yeah yeah yeah im seeing that interesting youre yeah yeah yeah i think you just enter in a number and see if its a even or an odd you just you ask please enter your number and then you have an input integer and then a variable of the integer being input into it and then you put  you kind of make a method like check whats odd or even and inside that you would put the modulus of the number that will input it like the x and then you return whether its even or odd you would put the if statement in the method or would you put that outside would you put the if statement inside the method or would you put that on the nevermind you would put it outside right okay you put the modulus  youre going to put the whatever you put the modulus inside the method right to get the remainder right and then you would get like if the remainder is oddcrosstalk  or even you could all right cool the what number check yeah yeah you would write it out and then you would put post static double no post static integer well what was even or odd is that its a string yeah yeah a integer yeah its an even is that it you okay you dropped your phone so youre going backwards because double equals mod cool that should be it no im good ill just do it at home ill just do it at home because i want to kind of go through the book i really just skimmed like the chapter  id feel better if i just read through the book just try to do it i dont know i kind of just skim it when i have time i try to read it but i wasnt  i havent had time in a while the one thats due  the assignment assignment oh this activity yeah well i do it while i read the book yeah because then im kind of going like what am i doing wrong and then i just i feel like most of the stuff that she assigns us you can go through the book and just find out about it that was weird yeah it was in the book it was just worded weird so do you just look online for most of your information or do you kind of just figure it out did you say you dont read the book ive done functions and like c sharp as well ascrosstalk  with methods but what do you mean what do you mean about modifiers what do you mean modifiers thats good whats your second one whats the second one youre going to take oh yeah really i was thinking about it but then i was wondering if there would be enough time for me to actually learn through it all thats three hours how many days is it monday wednesday and friday at eight dang what does the second class cover is it just more on java ah i think the exit form is already posted the sporadic reasoning im doing the paper and then im just going to try to modify the pdf so i could send it to him today are you  is what you doing youre not ah i must say positive i think its because we had the  with the little thing on it little microphone i hope not can we go yeah goodbye so what she meant when like you are missing some numbers you are just swapping them a little bit is that what she meant with the letters no just  no yeah that will be a lot more better idea than just pulling its just that heavy cord no just tell chris that well im done no no im fine ill do it yeah you really cant move with this on  is taking this off i think we have to wear it until chris takes it off of us   did you see it yet crosstalk  yeah i got my english well i havent been able to get my math yet but im going to go talk to my advisor tomorrow to see specifically what math i need i think the exit form is up im going to go  yeah its not my computer my brother did it actually i have a inaudible  right there just wait a second till i reach that point how do you do crosstalk  im doing good i dont know how im having trouble with the i didnt know they could be so hard yeah yeah and then they dont match at all oh thats neat cool you create the matrix then you loop it  times then you would get the columns and then you would get the random number between  and  it would be the columns then you assign that to one then you print that matrix then you would loop it  times and then you would search through each of those numbers to see if that would then print  different matrix that would be the loop  times and then a second method would be to search the matrix and then see if the matrix x and y match then its true you win if not its false so youd have to search through but since youve already assigned it to a specific index the first index no but i think yours is faster wouldnt it because its longer if youre checking through the index and seeing if they match its awesome i think im going to try that im going to do it the way that she did it first and then submit that and then try to do it the way that you did it since i have a free day tomorrow ill just try to do that i have a free day tomorrow no i got time off work where i only have to work on monday tuesdays and thursdays so i have to work on wednesdays and fridays so they say ive to spend time to study for projects and exams i work at this textile mill it pays the bills and car insurance commuting so yeah i cant complain about that it pays for things i think im fine i cant complain too much ill see you tomorrow no im going to do it now,marco  let  try  function  first  could  input  input  saying  like  flow  chart  like  enter  length  side  thencrosstalk  thought  supposed  like  figure  oh  yeah  nevermind  sorry  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  second  program  mean  guess  problem  basically  checking  using  remainder  like  modulus  check  like  acrosstalk  yeah  part  two  kind  working  assignment  hopefully  get  finished  time  get  home  way  dont  worry  yeah  way  start  like  really  study  test  thats  coming  two  week  said  lab  test  going  next  friday  going  friday  right  start  practicing  example  start  asking  question  get  back  monday  met  office  marcin  oh  really  im  eh  thinking  something  else  go  thing  yeah  feel  imagine  acting  got  pretty  well  guess  group  really  lot  people  acting  like  animal  like  dang  yeah  method  making  small  program  inside  program  yeah  yeah  called  put  yet  yes  named  yeah  yeah  yeah  im  seeing  interesting  youre  yeah  yeah  yeah  think  enter  number  see  even  odd  ask  please  enter  number  input  integer  variable  integer  input  put  kind  make  method  like  check  whats  odd  even  inside  would  put  modulus  number  input  like  x  return  whether  even  odd  would  put  statement  method  would  put  outside  would  put  statement  inside  method  would  put  nevermind  would  put  outside  right  okay  put  modulus  youre  going  put  whatever  put  modulus  inside  method  right  get  remainder  right  would  get  like  remainder  oddcrosstalk  even  could  right  cool  number  check  yeah  yeah  would  write  would  put  post  static  double  post  static  integer  well  even  odd  string  yeah  yeah  integer  yeah  even  okay  dropped  phone  youre  going  backwards  double  equal  mod  cool  im  good  ill  home  ill  home  want  kind  go  book  really  skimmed  like  chapter  id  feel  better  read  book  try  dont  know  kind  skim  time  try  read  wasnt  havent  time  one  thats  due  assignment  assignment  oh  activity  yeah  well  read  book  yeah  im  kind  going  like  wrong  feel  like  stuff  assigns  u  go  book  find  weird  yeah  book  worded  weird  look  online  information  kind  figure  say  dont  read  book  ive  done  function  like  c  sharp  well  ascrosstalk  method  mean  mean  modifier  mean  modifier  thats  good  whats  second  one  whats  second  one  youre  going  take  oh  yeah  really  thinking  wondering  would  enough  time  actually  learn  thats  three  hour  many  day  monday  wednesday  friday  eight  dang  second  class  cover  java  ah  think  exit  form  already  posted  sporadic  reasoning  im  paper  im  going  try  modify  pdf  could  send  today  youre  ah  must  say  positive  think  little  thing  little  microphone  hope  go  yeah  goodbye  meant  like  missing  number  swapping  little  bit  meant  letter  yeah  lot  better  idea  pulling  heavy  cord  tell  chris  well  im  done  im  fine  ill  yeah  really  cant  move  taking  think  wear  chris  take  u  see  yet  yeah  got  english  well  havent  able  get  math  yet  im  going  go  talk  advisor  tomorrow  see  specifically  math  need  think  exit  form  im  going  go  yeah  computer  brother  actually  right  wait  second  till  reach  point  im  good  dont  know  im  trouble  didnt  know  could  hard  yeah  yeah  dont  match  oh  thats  neat  cool  create  matrix  loop  time  would  get  column  would  get  random  number  would  column  assign  one  print  matrix  would  loop  time  would  search  number  see  would  print  different  matrix  would  loop  time  second  method  would  search  matrix  see  matrix  x  match  true  win  false  youd  search  since  youve  already  assigned  specific  index  first  index  think  faster  wouldnt  longer  youre  checking  index  seeing  match  awesome  think  im  going  try  im  going  way  first  submit  try  way  since  free  day  tomorrow  ill  try  free  day  tomorrow  got  time  work  work  monday  tuesday  thursday  work  wednesday  friday  say  ive  spend  time  study  project  exam  work  textile  mill  pay  bill  car  insurance  commuting  yeah  cant  complain  pay  thing  think  im  fine  cant  complain  much  ill  see  tomorrow  im  going,0.10635850991114147,1
working yeah im trying to figure out how to use the method thing this could be square yeah so it makes it more complicated i think oh wait thats  lets see double  let me see lets see double width equals  i think so but we have to use ifthen statements justif statements actually i think thats how we call them yeah thats what im trying to do right now oh this is going to suck yeah i think i got it to work for the square square inaudible  yeah so i just need to do that again for rectangle and then those other shapes so i did the actual math part and its own method the if statements i put the  whatd i do see i dont even know what i did because thats just a bunch of  but the ifthen statement is where i actually ask them for the side for the measurements and thats where i actually stored it yeah this is in the main method then the square method is only the math part yeah no i didnt do that did you do that oh really oh  points thats a lot of points if it is i should start doing that oh yeah i guess its  points in all mmhmm affirmative really i probably should do it because that test was rough yeah yeah and we still have another one right here oh thats tough oh yes okay i got the rectangle party yeah and i added another variable because you need the width and the length now for the triangle this is very tedious inaudible  crosstalk  okay i think i got a for the first one if you want to see it let me see if it runs okay the second program is a little easier i think yeah its just telling  seeing if its odd or even but the first one look how many lines of code my coding is really inefficient but it works do you want me to send you this hows yours ill put it in a word document oh yeah here you can take down your email oh alright thats mine should we even do the second one or do it later i kind of want to do it later what yeah oh what time is it oh my mmhmm affirmative oh yeah yeah that method yeah thats how it can compare it without the no it wasnt in the book you had to look on the website thats how i found it i know right thats basically how i learn in this class its just searching it up online mmhmm affirmative inaudible  yes  lets see if it works right so yeah i think we need a loop for that write set list for all of  hold on inaudible  split oh i think i know how to do that i can find out how many what is it called how many characters there are and then just divide it by two so and then i could use  what is that method where you can display only up to a certain index then i can use that number and halve it okay lets do this okay yes finally i mean we messed up a lot crosstalk  we got a hundred on them inaudible  crosstalk  yeah thats why ive been taking screenshots oh well yeah it is confusing because you have to do a loop and then an if statement within that loop that would be confusing too but ill start on that so basically after the inaudible  i think its  im a genius today is the last day to drop for what oh yeah thats a lot of points yeah inaudible  yeah you can make a  and still make an a i think  nevermind i dont know what happens in this class i know that test brought me down a lot yeah i made something like that its like really bad but then the last test was okay i think i got a b on that or something like that so that kind of averaged it out i dont know and the assignment yeah crosstalk  no no i was right not you inaudible  ah you cant do substrate thats what i was doing bruh yeah cause thats what i was going to do the substrate but i guess we cant i dont see how else you could do it though crosstalk  i guess we could do it with  crosstalk  yeah yeah roberts at the bar well i didnt use a method though this  yeah oh yes i forgot its recording you need to write the cognitive method in the  see they didnt use a method why use method four do you have any idea i dont think you could put the four looped in it can you do you want me to email you the program i know right yeah exactly yeah im a little scared for that test yeah i am too yeah laughter lets see about it man should i ask for crosstalk    let me do my exit and then ill inaudible  inaudible  stressed i am seeing smiling inaudible   yeah yay shes coming out yeah oh we finished yeah thank you yeah awesome oh man this again now we cant cuss yeah near the end laughter yeah she says she listens to all of them so i dont know yeah thats like what an hour each yeah so is this good for core a whats up okay thank you i think that should  yeah find the maximum byte duration crosstalk   what does he mean by find the maximum value of array by showing its value and index of crosstalk   okay so  so it just tells you whats the highest number okay thank you go for it lets see  use inaudible  songs inaudible   yep did you crosstalk  are you skipping inaudible  finish the ad version not sure if i did this right all right so ill do that and the bottom one oh wow thats simple cause i did this whole mess i put in a different crosstalk  method yeah so  did you do the maximum the part b part yet cause im not sure if i did it right so i want to see i mean i think did i switch it oh no they put max for this crosstalk  i dont think i did that whole crosstalk  right crosstalk  no i just need to find the elements that are higher than the average thats already done all right crosstalk  yeah thats what im trying to figure out cause thats a little much for me crosstalk  maybe you have to do an if statement actually like if the number is  yeah crosstalk  really wow and then we just have our final every day the second then next year that kind of sucks cause then we have to summary and then we probably forget everything oh yeah really oh what really its the same okay crosstalk  well this is okay so its basically a continuation its not really what wow thats really yeah i thought this is complicated yeah crosstalk  yeah all right crosstalk  they posted it oh i thought it was okay i didnt have enough time so i couldnt crosstalk  oh yeah there was one i couldnt get and i just left it out i just skipped over it yeah that was tough the beginning like the part a i stuck on that for yeah and then after that i was like god dammit we have to do this whole thing after so i couldnt finish it there was one crosstalk  just skipped it crosstalk  yeah its going to take yeah i was pretty bummed when i read the thing crosstalk  wow yeah this is really im trying to figure out how to put the new values in the new array so it says that we have to find all the values that are higher than the average and then we have to put it in a new array and another array so i have to figure out how to do that crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  i have no idea i dont know this is so hard yeah me too crosstalk  oh yeah searching okay  thank you i think its linear and then binary  why is this oh it doesnt have anything there if k equals  yeah thats what i yeah thats what im thinking but selection saved crosstalk  selections okay crosstalk  lets say these were in the method   im guessing theyre using this number as an index number but im not sure did you put it in  this wouldnt work because it doesnt tell us what the method is it doesnt show us a method it only shows us the main methods  i think i have no idea we had three attempts  thats true yeah i dont know why it would be three or one or negative one so im thinking its  because im thinking they might use this as an index number and the index at three zero one two three   okay lets say our main method looks like this i think its negative one i think when its out of range doesnt it return negative one or something like that im totally guessing because im not sure  yeah let me test that out ill just put a random thing in the other method crosstalk  oh no i hope thats like its dropping them and can we just honestly leave those down here no thats not going to work  i put it right here do you think it can still hear us yeah  just leave it down here  yeah a lot okay crosstalk  oh wait is that what its doing oh wait maybe i was wrong for this one maybe youre right that this is one yeah like the actual index of where three is that would be zero and then one then this would be also negative one because theres none in there yeah i think youre right then this would be three and six crosstalk   wouldnt this be binary because it divides it by two for question seven bubble for it what crosstalk   okay thank you crosstalk  do you think thats a thing they just made up or is it actually a thing oh  oh yeah crosstalk  oh okay it does it one after another so it just switches that so one is less than so it switches it and then four is less than five so it switches it so it does it onebyone the two pairs so its very simple actually  i didnt get that crosstalk   what yeah this is what i found out eight is going back to this question right here at six  yeah okay now i have to go back and lets see eight crosstalk  zero what crosstalk  since its what mmhmm affirmative oh that makes sense yeah that means nine would be thus resulting in a compiler error  okay  oh whoa crosstalk  this is still going back to eight  mmhmm affirmative crosstalk  all right inaudible  so its four right crosstalk   since our crosstalk  our new high variable is now at two what crosstalk   that equals two crosstalk  three four five six seven crosstalk  zero one two three four three no thats on here ah this is the low is here zero zero one two three four so wouldnt it be three seven zero one two three oh was what did you put for the mid to be three mmhmm affirmative wait if key is less than high equals six ugh crosstalk  so key is six six is less than  yes high equals mid crosstalk  x plus i got   mmhmm affirmative so before i got it equals two thats what i think  yes at four  yeah  mmhmm affirmative well on the actual code it says low plus high and high is seven because this subtracts one for some reason that would equal seven it divides it by two so wouldnt that be  but it turns into three then where am i going with this oh yeah i forgot what i was saying crosstalk  oh okay then it subtracts one so the high equals two because their mid was three and it subtracts one so its two  yeah crosstalk  this is what i got  what oh yeah this is what im guessing  mmhmm affirmative thats what im thinking and i put it in the id and it returned one  its like the smallest crosstalk  way back on  crosstalk  oh thats so hard  okay this is a bubble one i feel like that might be a bubble sort an immerse  sort crosstalk  yeah yikes im going to look at the code for this  bubble right  yeah this ones the one that looks really complicated this one crosstalk  what come on internet  thats what i think to this one the sorting stuff code  yeah no its fine its just frustrating  i forgot this was on five  yeah  of course shell say its easy shes the crosstalk  i o k and i crosstalk   yeah thats how much crosstalk   oh wow  oh he oh my gosh i thought there was only a few but apparently theres a lot more  yeah me neither im trying to figure out what exactly its wanting crosstalk  k equals and i equals zero swap crosstalk  five two crosstalk  im just going to skip it and go back to it  thats a lot of points crosstalk   mmhmm affirmative crosstalk   sure   nothing  i dont want to send out my google  i think its the column inaudible  an array sorry oh you used crosstalk  okay thats what i was thinking too  nothing crosstalk  calculating each row i cant even get to crosstalk  i was just trying to see if i can oh wait because i have a i havent even opened this yet thats what happened to them i got you  cant even get it to add how would you crosstalk  since you have multiples how would you do that if you randomly generate it if you didnt have to randomly generate it it would be a lot easier to do i dont know how we do one or two crosstalk  wait is this because this inaudible  to roll two setting that to i but how do you set how do you set the first one to the roll that you created you know because this is randomly generated no no no you know crosstalk  each row right so how do you tell it because its randomly generated so you dont know how many rows there are so you wont know how many you wont be able to tell a at row two you know because this right here is showing me how to add row two its about everything row two i dont know how to yeah because its random so im just trying to figure out inaudible  yeah thats not right it should be less than that crosstalk  it says that you crosstalk  this is the random generator and this as well inaudible  yeah just somethings wrong with them it looks like its not right right there sorry  okay crosstalk   yeah  im not crosstalk  dont say that crosstalk    and then the next four of them crosstalk   or possibly give more crosstalk   yeah i basically did crosstalk  right and then crosstalk   yeah crosstalk   its me bro what else did i crosstalk   i think were good thank you crosstalk    to crosstalk   no wonder crosstalk   i was just curious about that  yeah we should probably do those at least the pattern  no thats where i was yeah  i guess we just do it crosstalk  and just call  then you just call and its crosstalk   yeah we did the first one  we just answered it this way  he came just in time crosstalk  i guess crosstalk   is he okay  he wasnt in the lab crosstalk   same thing crosstalk   thats what we tried to do  okay  thats the confusing part crosstalk  yeah thank you crosstalk  thank you  yeah thank you crosstalk   you have crosstalk   is that what they want us to do  yeah crosstalk   is that right crosstalk  well i guess you can crosstalk     inaudible  crosstalk  when you make an array crosstalk  crosstalk  crosstalk  crosstalk  it automatically feels easier crosstalk  crosstalk  its supposed to inaudible  they all align right one crosstalk ,working  yeah  im  trying  figure  use  method  thing  could  square  yeah  make  complicated  think  oh  wait  thats  let  see  double  let  see  let  see  double  width  equal  think  use  ifthen  statement  justif  statement  actually  think  thats  call  yeah  thats  im  trying  right  oh  going  suck  yeah  think  got  work  square  square  yeah  need  rectangle  shape  actual  math  part  method  statement  put  whatd  see  dont  even  know  thats  bunch  ifthen  statement  actually  ask  side  measurement  thats  actually  stored  yeah  main  method  square  method  math  part  yeah  didnt  oh  really  oh  point  thats  lot  point  start  oh  yeah  guess  point  mmhmm  affirmative  really  probably  test  rough  yeah  yeah  still  another  one  right  oh  thats  tough  oh  yes  okay  got  rectangle  party  yeah  added  another  variable  need  width  length  triangle  tedious  okay  think  got  first  one  want  see  let  see  run  okay  second  program  little  easier  think  yeah  telling  seeing  odd  even  first  one  look  many  line  code  coding  really  inefficient  work  want  send  hows  ill  put  word  document  oh  yeah  take  email  oh  alright  thats  mine  even  second  one  later  kind  want  later  yeah  oh  time  oh  mmhmm  affirmative  oh  yeah  yeah  method  yeah  thats  compare  without  wasnt  book  look  website  thats  found  know  right  thats  basically  learn  class  searching  online  mmhmm  affirmative  yes  let  see  work  right  yeah  think  need  loop  write  set  list  hold  split  oh  think  know  find  many  called  many  character  divide  two  could  use  method  display  certain  index  use  number  halve  okay  let  okay  yes  finally  mean  messed  lot  got  hundred  yeah  thats  ive  taking  screenshots  oh  well  yeah  confusing  loop  statement  within  loop  would  confusing  ill  start  basically  think  im  genius  today  last  day  drop  oh  yeah  thats  lot  point  yeah  yeah  make  still  make  think  nevermind  dont  know  happens  class  know  test  brought  lot  yeah  made  something  like  like  really  bad  last  test  okay  think  got  b  something  like  kind  averaged  dont  know  assignment  yeah  right  ah  cant  substrate  thats  bruh  yeah  cause  thats  going  substrate  guess  cant  dont  see  else  could  though  guess  could  yeah  yeah  robert  bar  well  didnt  use  method  though  yeah  oh  yes  forgot  recording  need  write  cognitive  method  see  didnt  use  method  use  method  four  idea  dont  think  could  put  four  looped  want  email  program  know  right  yeah  exactly  yeah  im  little  scared  test  yeah  yeah  laughter  let  see  man  ask  let  exit  ill  stressed  seeing  smiling  yeah  yay  shes  coming  yeah  oh  finished  yeah  thank  yeah  awesome  oh  man  cant  cuss  yeah  near  end  laughter  yeah  say  listens  dont  know  yeah  thats  like  hour  yeah  good

affirmative  well  actual  code  say  low  plus  high  high  seven  subtracts  one  reason  would  equal  seven  divide  two  wouldnt  turn  three  going  oh  yeah  forgot  saying  oh  okay  subtracts  one  high  equal  two  mid  three  subtracts  one  two  yeah  got  oh  yeah  im  guessing  mmhmm  affirmative  thats  im  thinking  put  id  returned  one  like  smallest  way  back  oh  thats  hard  okay  bubble  one  feel  like  might  bubble  sort  immerse  sort  yeah  yikes  im  going  look  code  bubble  right  yeah  one  one  look  really  complicated  one  come  internet  thats  think  one  sorting  stuff  code  yeah  fine  frustrating  forgot  five  yeah  course  shell  say  easy  shes  k  yeah  thats  much  oh  wow  oh  oh  gosh  thought  apparently  there  lot  yeah  neither  im  trying  figure  exactly  wanting  k  equal  equal  zero  swap  five  two  im  going  skip  go  back  thats  lot  point  mmhmm  affirmative  sure  nothing  dont  want  send  google  think  column

trying  figure  yeah  thats  right  le  say  random  generator  well  yeah  somethings  wrong  look  like  right  right  sorry  okay  yeah  im  dont  say  next  four  possibly  give  yeah  basically  right  yeah  bro  else  think  good  thank  wonder  curious  yeah  probably  least  pattern  thats  yeah  guess  call  call  yeah  first  one  answered  way  came  time  guess  okay  wasnt  lab  thing  thats  tried  okay  thats  confusing  part  yeah  thank  thank  yeah  thank  want  u  yeah  right  well  guess  make  array  automatically  feel  easier  supposed  align  right  one,0.12497171129524066,1
is it working yeah thats pretty confusing you wouldnt have to use the method you could knock it out but its just like you have to use the method pulling out the book so lets see square so pretty much the four methods that were writing are just going to be for the rectangle triangle circle square pretty much we just pull that into the main right thats what were doing right oh okay you mean from the crosstalk  oh okay i wonder if our lab tomorrow is going to have us doing this nice awesome yeah i know so thats your main method right you did the whole thing the math part oh okay are you on the spatial reason crosstalk  oh you didnt do that yeah i did that its pretty easy yeah it was really easy actually i was wondering is that  points if you do all of it i think thats what it said all right is that what it says if you do all of them im telling you if you do it you can do it in five minutes yeah yeah you should you can make what  if you do all this extra credit i dont think theres one time that anybody has finished the assignment in class you know what i mean i know and this time we even have the flow chart we were supposed to do a flow chart for that first one too yeah yeah its pretty much the same thing right you just changed the gotcha gotcha is it which one is it oh its one of those oh okay lets see yeah you can i always like to compare and contrast my codes yeah well since you said that im just rewriting the if then yeah because i always  yeah so then i have to erase all that stuff and just to the math portion just like what you said so yeah yeah i break it so inaudible  crosstalk  you stay on campus or i said do you stay on campus yeah  im telling you hardly anybody finishes this assignment oh i didnt even know there was a  the equals ignore case i didnt even know that that negs this i did not know that i did not know that man what yeah because i was using it for  yeah i didnt know about that thats awesome is that actually in the book i must have missed it you know gosh man man this class is like all selftaught yeah inaudible  google and youtube man thats me thats my snow oh were not inaudible  crosstalk   okay that gets a string that counts the number of hours in inaudible  whats that lets see i dont know how to split do you know how to split didnt think about that thats what ive been doing too im just taking screenshots here and writing down the answers cause it seems like she pulls a lot softballs out of nowhere so thats what crosstalk  inaudible  she can hear us i forgot shes gonna know our secret i forgot oh im struggling honestly a lot okay i sot of got the inaudible  i have to be able to do it the way you do because i have to sit and think of it that takes me a while right yeah whats your name oh is that why he did it thats hilarious i mean you do this and ill be the other one fourteen inaudible  you do the spatial reasoning stuff and then you do this  point sections thats a lot of points thats why i decided to do this yeah i made a  on it yeah i dont know what to do about that oh well i dont know why they make such a big emphasis on crosstalk  for it because they only use it to chat for passwords and stuff thats what they mainly use it for inaudible  the chat the characters and stuff i guess it must be pretty important can i talk inaudible  first half too oh i dont know crosstalk   i mean inaudible   okay i think i got it damn man youre the man im sorry i  i didnt say that laughter yeah yeah this battle has been brutal the way its looking its not looking good for me anyway because i mean it takes a while especially when were like new to it you know even like the last one the mach  am with the test map it took me a like a whole week the whole time i didnt finish the second one i barely finished the first one and that was like straight to the end last one inaudible  a little extra credit i think were done with this oh yeah i got to get out too i guess theyre going to want this back  out oh and also …   okay we did last time didnt we i dont like lets  so for this study does she delete all the stuff after this class is done or   im guessing she listens to this stuff thats a lot of work man well i guess for some theres really nothing like us sometimes man i dont know whatever that means yeah and then its us  yeah that looks about like that should work yeah thats awesome but  so you can find the maximum of the arrays by  its  so thats the largest element  is that the same thing it sure is use variables store up inaudible   yes answer as opposed to inaudible  the largest element is fine the smallest one is inaudible   so use the inaudible  max to store the largest element or variable so index the max will find yeah so index the max of i yeah yeah thats fine someone wants to facetime yeah i know they dont know that youre at class was all over the place was just yeah im crosstalk  the ad inaudible  theyll just use this right here just take the total plus equals whatever oh you did the whole crosstalk  oh did you crosstalk  thats what i was going to do with one and two so that just pretty much just gives you the whole total and whole arrays all together just divided by no not yet is that one is like i said it was this right here crosstalk  so you can find them do they just want the minimum oh yeah this one here is the maximum crosstalk  thats no people just went home i almost want to do the crosstalk  i think im just the last two no no crosstalk  i got to get my extra credit i think thats on remember that exit poll crosstalk  yeah i dont know how to do that thats crosstalk  the ones that are hard i dont know if its greater than the average yeah i think this class is done after arrays yeah yeah cause i think chapter eight crosstalk  yeah the mind goes to object in class so crosstalk  yeah the second just take it over the summer im like no they recommend you not to take it over the summer yeah cause this is pretty confusing stuff yeah its like great so one of my buddies was going to teach this stuff over the summer so i can just jump right into it in the fall says you can take a lady named chow its an asian lady her name is chow basically its like a lady names chow shes a professor that teaches this they said to take her shes i dont know crosstalk  its all right its okay crosstalk  he says that its pretty much the same year round pretty much they teach you bare minimum and then you just do the same thing over and over crosstalk  yeah so its the same structure do it with your own buddy you have a buddy system too yeah thats all it is what else i do that other people who have taken other classes or doing my rbgs and stuff im like  rbgs im like we dont even touch that yeah thats nice crosstalk  its kind of weird that all the classes its the same class but yet they teach different materials i guess people will be up one i guess if they get the more advanced teacher i dont know crosstalk  howd you do on your lab test did you do okay no no i was just asking i know theres all this extra credit i cant even look at extra credit oh yeah i was too i totally forgot how to do that its pretty much like crosstalk  plus more i was like if it took me two days to do that crosstalk  yeah theres no way i bet we get back that test to one of the tas theyll probably end up taking them down about  to  minutes to write on so for us so its not for us but the students its going to take us two times longer crosstalk  or more at least yeah they cant be expecting that its crazy man yeah cause that last lab test i made like a  cause i didnt finish it its so annoying so youll put oh all of those okay all of those into so wouldnt you just put the new array set equal to that variable no because  no you cant do that cause theyre all individual crosstalk  i got too much stuff to do thank you  all right crosstalk  sequence of linear binary crosstalk  came in above what does this perform crosstalk  so log in searching the first one is searching did you already get that right  that one is searching  linear its crosstalk  yeah i agree  thats an odd binary because youre not dividing by two  not that lets see what selections were i think she was talking about it  i guess thats a linear  im pretty sure its linear  so four would be what one  wait  thats okay  thats true but it probably wont even show us  makes sense  it usually does yeah  should i put in the id  i hope its not us that are it should you know we put it down there we put i dont know  i would hope so  should be able to  i hope its not bio stuff shes referring to inaudible   that actual index so  yeah thats what i got  yeah we keep on driving it so we decided to no its an actual thing  because the inaudible   what is it so is eight return back to seven to complete this yeah okay i was like what it didnt make sense  so for eight you can compile them since its a lot smaller since its a lot smaller right because inaudible  it has to be smaller  nine would be crosstalk  to begin with  yeah  because thats what happened because crosstalk  the top so somewhere between inaudible  right  yeah i think it goes back to the bottom one explanation of inaudible   less than would be first crosstalk  yo for inaudible  did you get  or  thank you  at four i put you put a two right because then theres this splits here then six is plus so its crosstalk  the smaller half inaudible   this looks like a fan  i said i just asked my inaudible  on here  is one crosstalk  this you should have crosstalk  because we finished it  okay so that means were done already crosstalk   yeah that seems right then bubbles were and its because its like three  so multiple on this one  inaudible  bubble crosstalk   so what is this is this code referring back to oh my god  crosstalk  this is not easy  this isnt easy  inaudible  yeah its a lot i mean thats a deep sort i was like i gave her i just went to fucking  and had some going around yeah crosstalk  i hope to god inaudible   inaudible  the work crosstalk   inaudible  taking a break   always fun with these oh yeah thats right okay so i guess she is right its not that hard let me search how to declare it  wait what correct generate two random numbers between generate two random numbers between  to  to define the dimensions of the main array  oh okay yeah that makes sense nothing basically the user had to input something oh i thought it was just creating two random numbers for the row and the column and then its filling up with random okay thats what i thought honestly  im turning   so is this the row or the column the first one really its confusing  so is it row first and then column okay thank you  yeah thats thats crosstalk   yeah thats how i used the dry cleaner number i see how that works  what oh i think i got part b to work so its generating a random thing so its like yeah hopefully thats right calculate the average mmhmm affirmative oh does it have to say that calculate the average crosstalk  data type should be this okay all right  inaudible  okay  lets see thats fine thats fine one two three four five six one two three four five six  crosstalk  hmm plus  plus  plus  equals that divided by  what am i doing   plus  plus  equals that yeah i have no idea  what part are you stuck on oh yeah thats how you get to every part of the array you need a nested for loop which is annoying one for the column and one for the row no i mean getting the average thats what im stuck on i dont know  you have to call  yeah it would be easier if it wasnt random there has to be a way  it was the second one what average what are we doing wrong    i dont remember  plus  plus  plus  plus  plus oh  how do you set what oh so how do you put random numbers into the d array is that what youre asking add the yeah each row oh because you dont know how far it could go because its random i think you have to use a for loop and then set the maximum as a random number thats generated so lets say this number is  this loop will continue until it gets up to  the same thing for the column no wait i think i know why its not working actually crosstalk  it makes sense now okay  this needs to be a variable lets see if that works no thats the row  these are actually the average of the row though lets see  plus  plus  plus all right youre right it should be less than that i dont know what this is not even the column this is the row what because its  yeah and this is displaying it i dont understand row column  maybe i need to switch between i tried that it gave me an error yeah this is right  something isnt actually it is row column no idea oh does this need to be less than or equal to less than or equal to i dont think thats it though im desperate yeah thats not it          but i dont want that i want        maybe i need to switch these two maybe this should be column and this should be row thats going to give me an error isnt it yeah wait yeah it gave me an error  mmhmm affirmative  i think i have to save this to  yeah thats more confusing one crosstalk   you want me to put it afterwards  yeah yeah im not sure yeah instead of doing all of these crosstalk   yeah crosstalk   are we still on this one too  i was about to say im just crosstalk   nice crosstalk   no crosstalk  yeah because it would just be a flat line for the longest time  yeah crosstalk   i thought he was having one to our guide and he used methods i ended up putting in separate methods crosstalk  i put that crosstalk  because i know how to do that but im not sure about those parts  you know what were supposed to do right how many rows columns then the user inputs the  i just cant figure out how to put this into it with no method its so hard crosstalk   i wonder if you can return the method i mean return the no raytheon method crosstalk   lets see if that works  name crosstalk   its not working it wont let me crosstalk  i dont understand how long it said crosstalk   so hows crosstalk   i think so yeah thats how they take their  minutes crosstalk   i think so he texted me a couple days ago but he isnt going to go and he wanted me to send him the code but he didnt do that this morning crosstalk  its too late to drop out right of the class crosstalk  well he wasnt in the lab the other  yeah crosstalk  yeah he cant miss the class because hes so behind crosstalk   im just going to start on problem two because its taking too much time crosstalk   yeah well the current method that crosstalk  okay i need help on this part isnt this supposed to have two methods crosstalk  i knew how to do the method for the average but i didnt know how to do it crosstalk   can i crosstalk   i didnt know you could return  i just messed up on this part because you were supposed to put these fractions i guess crosstalk  so that makes problems here a lot easier because i know how to put in a crosstalk  you want me to send you the code for this  whenever you want the code you can just ask crosstalk  huh  i thought so to but apparently crosstalk  isnt there one where like each character go as an integer but one equals a or something crosstalk   i think so crosstalk  yeah i think youre right that you cant put a jar in it  actually no you can just put a jar in it because crosstalk    yeah im turning right now crosstalk  i got crosstalk  what yeah i finished i couldnt do the second extra credit that was too hard i was like oh ill just turn it in yeah it was really hard yeah how do i make it so if the user pressed enter thats fine the extra crosstalk  this sucks i cant find the logic for a search in i sort of got this blank part right but sometimes it gives me an error crosstalk  yeah oh maybe we need to save i crosstalk ,working  yeah  thats  pretty  confusing  wouldnt  use  method  could  knock  like  use  method  pulling  book  let  see  square  pretty  much  four  method  writing  going  rectangle  triangle  circle  square  pretty  much  pull  main  right

thank you i like it too  were going to be playing around with methods here definitely in this activity  to enter a shape and its dimension  its a crosstalk  we actually have to draw a flow chart though thisll be pretty easy actually basically what it is is were going to have conditional statements itll be enter a shape name we can crosstalk  different ways to go about that my probable choice is that someone will put in the shape name and itll take the first character because then when that happens it switches to the methods the methods will have you input the specific details for each one then bada bing bada boom that means if they misspell it crosstalk  i mean if you misspell rectangle should we ask if we need to  yeah ask if we actually need to do the flow chart well worst comes to worst we can say that inaudible  which is the least helpful way to do a flow chart also yeah turn that off what this one that makes sense yeah thats pretty neat name what are we going to name this program there he is what well youd probably want it to be the char because thats what were just going for yeah inaudible  this would be char what type of shape do you want the area of i have a lot of formality with my crosstalk  here lets do char crosstalk  itd help if i imported the scanner no because its crosstalk  type char choice is equal to next line always goes to has next line char crosstalk  there we go yeah were at zero its all good man well what are the dimensions will be in the methods in each individual method youre doing great man you got this no problem lets make the methods first i guess is this going to be double or is this going to be  yeah its gonna have to be double wait crosstalk  rectangle technically it doesnt have to be double it can be integer what yeah static void double oh wait its not a  it wouldnt be  sorry hmm yeah yeah i havent done it yet i figure ill make the methods and then ill put them in public static void square aw son of a gun were going to have to initialize the scanner for each method yeah hmm we probably will have to use the method just for the calculations then i screwed that one up were going to want to do if statements if choice equals s  basically this is going to help us that we dont have to initialize a scanner every single time which is probably what we were supposed to do first off but you know what is the length of a side of the square thats going to be after we get their input  here what is the length of the side of the square well put int side is equal to input dot next int then once we get that we do first off int square int side okay i got it area is equal to  times  crosstalk  there we go then you do  if we do a square  yeah well i just did i just did that then return  times a and that should work just its in the main method right now it would go outside of the main method but not outside of the class heres  there we go give me one second now crosstalk  rectangle rectangles not going to be as bad or its not going to  hang on the if choice  what is the length of a rectangle by the way i hope youre happy that i now using night mode on this thing too thank you i did it for you nah not really i just thought it was really cool okay area equal to  whats going on yeah except that there are two dimensions for the rectangle length and width you even registered that for the method you might want to declare area in each one because areas going to be doubles for later ones at least thats what i did lets see if this works whats the length of the rectangle lets do  cool yeah and just declare it each time even though it sounds like itll be a pain in the butt  or initialize sorry not declare the reason why is because when you do circle and the triangle thisll save you some headache one of the plus sides to using chars is that you dont have to worry about crosstalk  at least i dont think you do crosstalk  double  what im not judging were just using  in this case yeah im doing circle no not yet i didnt realize  yep circles after triangle crosstalk  it really just seemed like the crosstalk  what for triangle and circle yeah yeah yeah great what is the radius of the circle equal to crosstalk  im killing it right now not really lets see if the circle thing works well ive got bad news we need to do double for all of these thats what the assignment said its still just a quick change can i just take every int on here and change it to double actually can i do that i just copied and paste it so i inaudible  just it quickly i did this to myself why am i still getting an error oh all right done everything now is a dub hold on sorry about what yeah  sorry yep  you asked for a radius i said the  sorry what rectangle lets do  times  okay cool square will be super easy yeah lets do   crosstalk  now we just need to do triangle were doing good you already did triangle i havent yet though yeah i dont know what youre talking about flow charts are the best part who wants to actually get involved with the code oh boy it actually sounds kinda cool oh boy yeah well crosstalk  that at least makes sense to me because its area triangle do do do do do do do do do do do do crosstalk  okay the triangle is base times height over two yeah thats what i did i usually do that wheres sarah laying that down wow the second question is a lot easier thats okay this isnt going to take too long at all  you all right yeah yes why does the assignment say enter and integer i mean im going to make one in the method  returns the result to the main method no crosstalk  odd or even by doing modulars by doing a modular of it yeah turn yeah thats the one i was trying to crosstalk  thats good idea hang on so youre gonna wanna declare an integer of the statement so id say the if statement will go underneath the declare integer so like and then if  totals one we just have to say the number is odd or even oh no we have to say the actual number so  yeah yeah because if you do a modular two its either gonna equal one or zero i mean you could do it equal to zero as well its just an if else so whatever you prefer yeah crosstalk  yeah see i think im gonna like methods though yeah i try my best i appreciate that crosstalk  probably do it tomorrow so that might be a problem for me tomorrow and its   yeah nice yeah im not too excited inaudible  so the real question is how do i get them inaudible  just ask nicely how do we get them like now forgot about the exit point  wheres sarah found sarah  youre fine crosstalk  oh man sorry  yeah the recorder its still recording though its just this this is really  okay okay hold up so were doing great ill move this around okay alrighty so  so first of all one of the things that we can do is two lower case so that we dont have to worry about two different alphabets we can just worry about one and that still raises the question of what are we gonna do lets do crosstalk  so we know that a e ah i a e i o u for some reason i just forgot about the vowels im probably not counting y crosstalk  well thats the problem is that like  well figure this out youre  probably cause of the i in there but if youre switching it off from crosstalk  sentence link the sentence link is just gonna be  a single integer its not gonna change that was a close one this feels like a trick the k oh the ks outside of the four statement damn it inaudible  probably gonna get this one wrong too all right welcome to the cold embrace of death its a joke if  makes sense okay thanks hey im sorry two no no maybe the cat yeah the cat too e no problem okay okay a e i o u yeah i still need to do string what all to be in a method yeah so itll take in the string and itll print out the integer alright well done let me so string sentence is equal to that so lets just do system dot is equal to shit there we go so lets see if this works so what is it that you tried the cat i got two for that so lets do hello my baby two three looks like it works since length is technically one higher than the index would be for the length that would crosstalk  whats wrong not in the side method okay so youd just say that your integer or name an integer like i put vowels is equal to count underscore vowel parentheses and then whatever your string was that the user inputted which would be sent no youd name it outside of that method yeah so what you called vowel i called count no youd do ent count equals count underscore vowel if thats what you named your method yeah and then say whatever your string name is which i guess is sent no problem just gonna put five es and see if this works it counts five es how quaint my god what have i done okay so first inaudible  ah boy so im probably gonna work on the other one before we even start on the flowchart fair enough okay so whats the other okay so been through the string below okay so for the other one okay problem two okay i know how we can do this substrings so for the second problem we cant use the split method so what we can do instead is create two substrings one that goes up to right before the index that the user enters and one that goes from the index that the user enters so say they use the hello method it goes up to two so then zero one and then two three four so well have it set as two substrings ill show you in the code so we can do the same thing from the last one if we enter the string string string sentence equals input next line enter the index to split you alright that sounds like a pretty rough time equals input lets see if it freaks out okay so we should be good okay wait were gonna have to return two strings for the method how do we do that we can do it as a void and do it as a print line in the method or thats probably not what they want us to do did you think about doing substrings i dont know it just said we couldnt use split but i guess substrings would be okay i dont know though im just asking about how we get back to things well no we dont have to do the whole concatenate thing we can just do substrings what so basically all that it is is that you put in so as you can see on the map or through the api here put in the substring and what it does is it makes a string based off of the first string that you have from a beginning index to an end index or just from a beginning index so say what wed want for our first substring would be from zero to the userinputted index well technically the userinputted index minus one oh yeah okay well putting it in the method isnt necessarily the problem its a question of how it returns because we would technically have two strings that would be returned yeah oh yeah the substring no problem my god whatve you done oh god i was being sarcastic but couple hundred dollars gone couple hundred dollars back were all okay now i have a question are we allowed to use substrings for the second part of the activity yeah okay let me check well see yeah i have my two four loops well hang on cause it says in one method so thats the yeah if we do void though what we could do is instead of returning something we could print the answers there so system dot out dot print line yeah part one if thats wrong i dont know badum bum bum okay so then you would just need to do there we go okay so for this one we did the usual going through the loop and concatenating for each index and then what i had was that that was my magic thing first half is equal to first half plus eight crosstalk  i put split string a into b okay so first you wanna get the length into length is equal to your string dot length whatever your string is so sent one dot length okay then youre gonna wanna declare two variables string i called mine first half yeah and just leave that void so four and then youre gonna wanna do a four statement so four ent whatever your index is i is equal to zero index is less than your integer that we were given so split index plus plus first half is equal to first half plus a dot char at index no first is equal to first dot im sorry plus your sentence sent one dot yeah sorry okay okay yep and then the next loop is up until the length a would equal b yeah yeah split and then index is less than length since you have to  or go ahead and use length so that youre not yeah and its just less than length because length is always one higher than index plus a dot char at oh yeah sorry sentence char at i or no a yeah nope yeah dot there you go like that so then the return would be what so instead of return since this is void youre just gonna do system out print line inside of the method and that might not be right well have to see thats just the only way that i can see pulling out two sub strings in the thing what no youre gonna take the variables that are included in the main so thatll be after the fact though youre fine okay okay oh in set and first and second equal to empty it freaks out if you dont do that sometimes yeah there you are so now all that youre gonna have to do is go into the main method yep and then put whatd you call it okay so put sent just on its own sent to yeah hey you said it not me wait what did you do with your loops oh less than split not less than or equal to there we go there we go makes sense that makes sense i hope thats not gonna be an issue with  oh god thats probably gonna be an issue with that whew im just gonna try not to think about that flow chart draw dot io oh no ill be good you said what dont worry about it ill be good yeah yeah oh no problem i am not sadly im leaving tomorrow so thank you lets hope this isnt terrible okay and then inaudible  no im just not gonna do it sorry see if we can get un micd hey nick can we get a mic inaudible  yep  okay just wanted to make sure wooh were killing it okay so sizes are equal to now so  okay okay is my script making it on oh i knew that inaudible  okay so  and i is less than or and i equal to zero that is that so whats up just to make sure that were on the same boat and im not doing something really stupid i did four into i is equal to zero i is less than array a dot length i plus plus and then what thats gonna do is for each index itll create a random number generator oh less than or equal to size well no because oh wait no yeah youre right youre right zero to nine  if its like  then itd be zero to nine thatd be less than  so you were right you were right the first time youre fine sorry what yeah the math dot random array a for i equal to it would help if i could spell random right oh god i forgot the formula for math dot random oh yeah holy cow i really did forget it what is it oh yeah wouldnt it be times oh yeah nine you are correct its an off day yeah youre right youre right its an off day okay so should we display the array so that like we know wait how do you display the array actually would that be another four loop or would that be a four while where does four while come in again or four each whatever its called okay no not yet i think you might have to make another loop no okay thats just a system out dot printout or dot print i guess okay okay yep           i think were doing well so yeah that makes sense ill just have the numbers okay so then after that return max luckily in the textbook theres something directly about that there it is okay so int max equal to array a zero so then try another four loop yeah inaudible  array nope if my list  no alright greater than max inaudible  whoopsies okay so inaudible  higher values than the average okay okay there we go so next we have to find the average okay so how do we calculate the average oh you just have a running total add it together in a loop and then divide it by the size so like so we do int total is equal to array a of zero basically were doing a similar thing as the last four loop okay okay so greater than inaudible  so total plus is equal to array a of i and then total  oh lets do double oh no for the average wed want it to be outside of the remember we need to convert it to double over no complaints here okay i just wanna check this real quick thats five plus six plus eight wait a minute our math dot random has to be times ten or wait no its from one to nine isnt it yeah yeah yeah times  yeah because if we have it just times nine nine will never show up i just realized because id never seen a nine and im like ive seen every other number at this point why havent i seen a nine okay so we have the max we have the average find the elements that have the higher values than average value okay lets see if that prints out perfectly the average of the array is one the max is  okay for this you need to create a new array with the same type and size of source array and name it high values actually im betting average is probably just supposed to be an integer for this because otherwise thatll complicate things down the road for us int average is equal to total over size hooray so now  now we need to make a new array high underscore values size time for another loop for the high values array what okay yeah yeah with array a i might be a little rough inaudible  average so if all the elements  oh my gosh im so sorry yeah okay okay were killing it sorry just give me one minute what the hell have i done okay so crosstalk  lets grab your pen im going to so how do you print out the high values array yeah do you create another loop for that yeah so once you create the array for high values how do you display that back to the user right here where okay right yeah what this im not outputting anything here this is  im saying that the value of the array or this part of the array is equal to this value cause were supposed to create another array for this okay oh yeah i see whats going on yeah i print as high values instead of we have to make it the same size same type and size of source array and arraignment high values youre fine crosstalk  what does not work you are correct oh you know why it doesnt work yeah i dont know whats going on with that ah crosstalk  okay inaudible  no oh were just having a bit of trouble with the high values problem no with putting it in the new array i think is the issue this is what were playing with if thats above the average then  but i think theres something wrong with the methodology here because when we do that it shows that the high values are all of those so this side is the user input integer okay there we go crosstalk  just put brackets around the whole  the print statement and the high values is equal to array high to put and you print out so so so so okay so so the next one that we have to do is just a reshuffle rerandomize the numbers so thats a pretty easy one no i think they literally mean just we randomize the numbers so basically we run it through mouth dot random again i believe so yeah no they said shuffle the print will cease just rerandomize the values so i guess just copy the first one yeah same array our big challenge now is to create another array of the same type and source im going to get really original here gonna call it array b to cover the other one your array a b and c equals it would help if i put brackets around or by the name of the array okay the first thing im going to do is create an integer called half way which is size over two so if its like say seven then name it target yeah you are correct damn you naming conventions ruin the gap  oh so we can do another four loop oh okay yeah so four   so int i is equal to zero i is less than halfway yeah i call it halfway i created an integer for i dont know i like to name things thats easier for me more complicated but you know so that i know what im doing so just the target of i plus halfway cause zero plus three so like lets say with the seven three would be seven over two zero plus three would then get you to that position  yeah well the first half is already generated cause thats where the array ends array a is the source target of the target so target is the only one that youre creating for this bit because so lets say that the halfway point  like look at this one right here the halfway point is three right so i plus three would mean zero plus three then put it in the same index position as the halfway point does that make sense so i equals one itll put it in the four stop i equal two itll play it in the five spot yeah oh were going to have to do array a in another  or were going to have to do the target one in another loop so we can display the empty spaces crosstalk  what this thats size cause im just going to display target in another loop so that we can show the empty spaces if this works ill explain what i meant it will not work whats going on okay target is the same size okay size okay target size and then int a equals a is less than size divided by two a plus plus target a plus size divided by two and then my array lets check and see if that sticks to that actually cause thats a pretty huge difference there you go yeah lets just make sure real quick is it okay for the blank spaces if it displays zero is that like where its supposed to be with the target array or is it supposed to be  the first half blank is it okay if its zero check the math on what i can do that real quick just to make sure okay so were talking about one three plus five less seven eight plus seven plus four over ten three point six so ill round down the three for integer oh yeah i should do that too were supposed to ake it and split it in half basically and put the first half and the second half of the target first half should be blank yeah awesome yeah okay just wanted to make sure yes oui oui mon ami inaudible  is one of the easier classes for me so far it was kinda fun once i got down to it yeah  every day no problem so right under the  oh no inaudible  then yeah sorry f per s number  reference  out of  okay lets go to the next one yep killin it so now activity b this ones worth  points with  questions okay i like the ones like this yes for an argument of an array type the value of the argument is a okay yeah reference the reference value is past the methods semantically can be best described as a passively shared that is yeah tenth and b is  crosstalk  b is  number is  crosstalk  yeah num is zero its two numbers one is three what is a not in the scope i guess would be the   there is no a in the main method or in the method yeah method then ow a is still equal to  pretty sure hang on oh yeah a is equal to  youre right i think so it think youre right you have primitive variables turn into a method and their values change from the method that value will also be up to back at the main you know im gonna check this real quick cause theyre scaring me oh okay i think thats true for number  well i was just looking at the definition cause yeah inaudible  sharing okay so a would be the same yes a after the method after the method call but crosstalk  question  after being called the method a would be the same as before so it would be  but zero would be the one that changed yeah where does it say it this is because y and numbers although they are independent variables reference the same array as illustrated in figure  when m xy are invoked the values of x and y are passed to number and numbers since y contains the reference value to the array numbers on contain the same reference value to the same array sorry thats for the thing in the textbook so in a permanent variable it will not be updated back at the main but when an array is it would be true mmhmm affirmative uhoh okay so that would be  what so the problem is that it looks like the main of the method that they use yeah okay no okay theirs is my question because theirs it doesnt accept an array it accepts an integer see into theirs theres no brackets not brackets but you know what im talking about past by a reference okay what did you get oh  so i think what happened was since it didnt do anything it just skipped it so then it just printed out my potatoes which is  uhhuh affirmative and since youre only looking at the first index of each one so yeah i think that makes sense only the above code the main difference between the increased mine and increased theirs methods increased mine takes in an array passed by a reference while increase theirs takes in an int past by a value i think thats crosstalk  i think so too well next i know this one program  copies the reference while program  values of list  are copied into list  however they both remain separate arrays im pretty sure you might wanna check that i might have completely switched it up in my head okay yeah and i put it the other way because if you just put list  is equal to list  that just copies the reference but if you do the loop that copies all the values of one list to the other yeah it was this so you could attempt in such cases you could attempt to use the assignment statement as follows this statement does not copy the contents of the array referenced by list  but instead merely copies the reference value so program  doles that value and the other program copies the entire array but its two separate arrays i think its the first one for that question yeah okay lets see how this goes im back to tears ooh  out of  there we go inaudible  life goes on that was a fun one we actually knew coding now i just realized i hope my beard isnt interfering with the mic feed too much yeah just a little bit i should have had this program open before thats why im taking so long just waiting for this damn thing to open i mean someone is gonna have me slightly whistling apache jump on it while i awesome oh sweet baby jesus testing this is gonna be a pain in the butt  names definitely you know i had a picture cause i did this cub before aw dang it i cant find it this is gonna suck deja vu code yeah call this name search name search   this is how you declare a  this is how youd declare an array again right okay just wanna make sure length  enter your names oh and now we get to make a  loop whats going on whats wrong having trouble with a  loop inaudible  its plus no wow equals inaudible  im sorry lemme get a little closer here just trying to  its cause youre  news not the name of your scanner scan yes so for me it would say input dot next line no problem inaudible  and thats how you fill the array now the next question is  how do we do the search but with  what yeah oh maybe its a thing about how we have to sort it first yeah what yeah yeah that makes sense youre gonna use the oh god oh my god what have you done im joking the bio okay there we go that makes sense though okay so were gonna have to create that into a method though so int inaudible  public static yeah its recording still youre fine  okay now if  name  so this is what i did you can tell me how crazy it is so i put  int is equal to i is equal to  alright i made a  loop it goes through the entire thing and i did if a equals b return i whats that say okay lets see if this works enter if name  so you go through the  loop can i look at yours real quick oh wait i think it would be if a of i b yeah hang on return i yeah whats wrong type int is the return negative one outside of the  loop okayget that out of there then wait got it yeah you listen here you piece of crap i was straining at the end of that ill give you that i was like oh jim joe bobby i went to vague country names first i dont know why bobby joe tim joe billy bob oh yeah yep  how did you do on the test by the way   thats really depressing though because that means my curve before curve thats  so you know  like our full test grades im betting thats a typo not a mine is like an  percent  that would not be good for more than  but what i think it was was just a clerical error oh my god what have i done yeah  here ill hold it  youre fine there we go okay we just have to get a little closer hope thats okay  so i dont even have bubble sword on here eight hundred what hang on  im just going to look at the flow charts yeah how does this work no why am i doing this to myself sorry  hey nick i have a question could you explain to me what bubble sword is wait so does the video explain nevermind i found a video  never mind thank you though heres a video yeah i just dont have headphones i have speakers it doesnt even matter theyre not even saying anything  oh i got you  okay okay  oh the five and the two they wont even let me select this eight okay eight so why did it change okay yeah thats okay so it was three two five eight then three two five eight all right and then it goes so it always checks to see if the one on the right is the bigger number  and then if its not it switches oh and then it decreases the limit value every time so it works like the opposite of the other one wheres the opposite end in a slightly different way eight so then that one would be oh that one would be two three hmm so that one would still be three two okay one and zero and one one and one okay so if k equals one and i equals one and i okay i dont understand that i equals zero oh so that one would be three two five eight because it would go onto the next one and wouldnt flip two and zero it goes back three and two need to swap zero three five i think you might just be straight up right with that i might be wrong though okay so thats  a selection let me see in the book where it talks about selection select okay for i equals two so that would be two three five so i think for i equals two it wouldnt change anything because five is already the lowest oh wait i dont understand selective search because i cant find in the book where it talks about wait she was talking about selective there oh here it is wait no linear selective search yup sorry for that one no because so this first one its looking to make sure that the first variable is the lowest so it checks against all of these okay two is the lowest right the next one checks against all of them to see that threes the lowest or the lowest out of everything beyond that so the next one will be checking if fives the lowest and five is the lowest now the next major change would be two three five zero one two three nine eight then the next one it would be the same and then the last one would be yup at least from what ive understood  out of  where did we answer differently thats right this one thats right negative one and the array wasnt sorted to begin with our middle element is three so we then check the upper half in which case six doesnt exist negative one is returned it has to be sorted for binary search yes now how can we think the counselors cheating given that youve done all of these already and gotten them mostly right yeah yeah  nice do you need the eight and nine isnt it eight and nine i can tell you eight and nine when you get to them im gonna check and see theres no way that can be it i mean im not complaining go ahead and work on that exit point so wait is there an etext for this class yeah i was like wait a minute have i been missing something this whole time yeah but i mean like etext activities or whatever okay good three yup youre looking good youre in the clear that makes sense there you go now you just need to do your exit you are good to go my friend lets see about getting this mic off of us now i feel like im in a stage play again when i wear these because you always have to have these clipped on to make sure the people can hear you its like the most halfassed hand raising ive done it just seems like theyre all busy at the moment that goes for that on the mic were done  i think thats a point in everyones life the more you know wouldnt you have to open this like hello and welcome to the computer nerd podcast hey if it works it works  oh yeah thats true yeah because gold is softer than most metals yeah yeah that means define it  okay okay man okay between two and nine two nine inclusive define the dimensions of the main array this tuesdays hit us hard hasnt it this tuesday has hit us hard thats what im gathering from our current mental situation like a freight train  the average does not have to include digits after decimals  okay so this is activity  one is the loneliest number that youll ever be  activity yeah  going to more arduous than anything else but given the fact that like this is all that we have it wont be too bad okay i dont know what to call this program d array maybe mmhmm affirmative oop nope d array is not a valid identifier  oh numbers oh yeah number first isnt it because i said d array and it was like thats not valid no it was the  that was the problem so we dont even have to import scanner okay somatic wave name its math dot how do we declare the size of the array yeah thats what those random numbers are oh and but wait if its  thats the lowest number oh wait no no no random integers between oh no no no  to  so   oh my gosh  great so thatd be max minus min plus  would equal  plus  because  or maximize yeah  so we have to make it from  to  right so max would be  minus min would be  or max minus min would be  plus  would be  plus the min on the outside of b plus  yeah  doesnt include  in it probably because a  dimensional  row array looks kind of boring okay then columns for int row equals zero row  for this int beautiful oh shit okay so it looks like theyre going to store the beta type as a  we can just make the data types int for the average and maximum average  yeah did they require it to be a double matrix int yeah from  to  yeah so times  plus  wait what oh because  is the minimum i mean if its  from  yes  but and now make it  to  or  to  yeah the plus  is supposed to be on the outside of the yes yes  at least im pretty sure it does might not who knows but it helps me understand it better  and remember declaring these again i read it just a second ago lets just see about printing out this matrix now god damn door okay okay so lets see what this looks like that is         thats within parameters     thats within parameters  i see s and s meaning that those numbers are within parameters nothing below nothing above okay so  no because print the average of all columns the average does not have to include digits after decimal points  so we can store that as integers    over   aced so we need to make a  loop of im going to have to make a nested  loop  yeah  its like every problem for this has a nested  loop somewhere in the solution its like a  branch flow chart that leads to a nested  loop  okay  see the problem is were adding up rows or sorry yeah so we do it a little differently than what weve been doing  actually it might just be backwards like you just do int column is equal to  row is less than matrix wait no this is going to work a little differently oh for int row is equal to   matrixblank no not hash code nope i screwed it up the amount of rows is not  defined amount  oh okay i know whatll happen  okay so it would be a flipped thing though column would be on the outside  or would it be oh all the rows are the same length so it doesnt matter  whats wrong oh youre printing every value of column   and  like what does this look like if i scroll up can i get a scroll so it looks like youre printing everything not adding up and averaging  oh guess what we also have something on here about summing elements by column oh thats what you used okay so  thats kind of the same stuff that i was using though but i just didnt figure that stuff out before so int total is equal to  int oh wait put that in the wrong place  killing it right now  okay so  going pretty well i think i have the maximum average calculation done but i will check real quick yeah ive got that all done yeah like this is what i got oh shit not that lets get rid of that this is what i got though  oh youre fine so what i did was i created a value called max average  and so what it does is that at the end of every loop through the columns instead of the rows i do an if statement of if the average is greater than max average then max average becomes the average so it saves the average as the max average because yeah outside of the row loop but not outside of the column loop  no if average is greater than max average  map or equals average  yeah in main method not in any loops you print the max average is plus max average since we dont have to worry about providing what index its in that makes it easier although havent checked these averages lets check that real quick before i am so sure of myself  what i just did it the national international mens i just think its kind of fun and it looks good its great to afford doing a lot of drinking because then you wake up the next morning feeling like shit but then also like yes and thats all been recorded now im  its fine correct  howd you get  yeah wait so  oh i think you added up your averages  i was like wait a minute  well but the problem is  the average cant be higher than  though oh what because you dont get any numbers higher than  what is going on mmhmm affirmative  total plus is equal to is matrix row column yeah  and then average is equal to total over matrixlinked mmhmm affirmative  i dont know if thatll do much like i dont know what the issue is here  oh yeah because you dont reset total to   ah yep at least thats all thats on the paper and if thats all thats on the paper im not going to ask for more  she sells sea shells down by the sea shore unique new york unique new york start my opera lessons okay  what did you make  oh because you did the bonus work  nice job man okay so it looks like we have everything together im going to say were good lets hope fingers crossed  activity  correct  i dont know if she heard you   so i was thinking well if its a double array then that means when we calculate the average later on itll return a double average well actually it doesnt matter if its double i guess we can convert that later one so yeah just keep it as an integer array that makes sense here in this class we know things sometimes okay this one will be called average array im great with naming my programs thats all good thats not an ending okay so int okay so i guess ill do systemout input these so it sets the array okay row equals no well fill it in the method for actually making the yeah so well create a for loop inside the thing my god what have i done okay do it again okay so when we filled this out it was so for int row is equal to zero row is less than matrix dot  yeah wait that was on activity  okay yeah awe man im still confused okay any s yes okay yep okay just want to make sure that i got my numbers right so where do we go from here well we have an idea already of how to do a search yes activity  thats when we did the search what did you do oh this is going to be interesting,thank  like  going  playing  around  method  definitely  activity  enter  shape  dimension  actually  draw  flow  chart  though  thisll  pretty  easy  actually  basically  going  conditional  statement  itll  enter  shape  name  different  way  go  probable  choice  someone  put  shape  name  itll  take  first  character  happens  switch  method  method

basically  similar  thing  last  four  loop  okay  okay  greater  total  plus  equal  array  total  oh  let  double  oh  average  wed  want  outside  remember  need  convert  double  complaint  okay  wan  na  check  real  quick  thats  five  plus  six  plus  eight  wait  minute  math  dot  random  time  ten  wait  one  nine  isnt  yeah  yeah  yeah  time  yeah  time  nine  nine  never  show  realized  id  never  seen  nine  im  like  ive  seen  every  number  point  havent  seen  nine  okay  max  average  find  element  higher  value  average  value  okay  let  see  print  perfectly  average  array  one  max  okay  need  create  new  array  type  size  source  array  name  high  value  actually  im  betting  average  probably  supposed  integer  otherwise  thatll  complicate  thing  road  u  int  average  equal  total  size  hooray  need  make  new  array  high  underscore  value  size  time  another  loop  high  value  array  okay  yeah  yeah  array  might  little  rough  average  element  oh  gosh  im  sorry  yeah  okay  okay  killing  sorry  give  one  minute  hell  done  okay  let  grab  pen  im  going  print  high  value  array  yeah  create  another  loop  yeah  create  array  high  value  display  back  user  right  okay  right  yeah  im  outputting  anything  im  saying  value  array  part  array  equal  value  cause  supposed  create  another  array  okay  oh  yeah  see  whats  going  yeah  print  high  value  instead  make  size  type  size  source  array  arraignment  high  value  youre  fine  work  correct  oh  know  doesnt  work  yeah  dont  know  whats  going  ah  okay  oh  bit  trouble  high  value  problem  putting  new  array  think  issue  playing  thats  average  think  there  something  wrong  methodology  show  high  value  side  user  input  integer  okay  go  put  bracket  around  whole  print  statement  high  value  equal  array  high  put  print  okay  next  one  reshuffle  rerandomize  number  thats  pretty  easy  one  think  literally  mean  randomize  number  basically  run  mouth  dot  random  believe  yeah  said  shuffle  print  cease  rerandomize  value  guess  copy  first  one  yeah  array  big  challenge  create  another  array  type  source  im  going  get  really  original  gon  na  call  array  b  cover  one  array  b  c  equal  would  help  put  bracket  around  name  array  okay  first  thing  im  going  create  integer  called  half  way  size  two  like  say  seven  name  target  yeah  correct  damn  naming  convention  ruin  gap  oh  another  four  loop  oh  okay  yeah  four  int  equal  zero  le  halfway  yeah  call  halfway  created  integer  dont  know  like  name  thing  thats  easier  complicated  know  know  im  target  plus  halfway  cause  zero  plus  three  like  let  say  seven  three  would  seven  two  zero  plus  three  would  get  position  yeah  well  first  half  already  generated  cause  thats  array  end  array  source  target  target  target  one  youre  creating  bit  let  say  halfway  point  like  look  one  right  halfway  point  three  right  plus  three  would  mean  zero  plus  three  put  index  position  halfway  point  make  sense  equal  one  itll  put  four  stop  equal  two  itll  play  five  spot  yeah  oh  going  array  another  going  target  one  another  loop  display  empty  space  thats  size  cause  im  going  display  target  another  loop  show  empty  space  work  ill  explain  meant  work  whats  going  okay  target  size  okay  size  okay  target  size  int  equal  le  size  divided  two  plus  plus  target  plus  size  divided  two  array  let  check  see  stick  actually  cause  thats  pretty  huge  difference  go  yeah  let  make  sure  real  quick  okay  blank  space  display  zero  like  supposed  target  array  supposed  first  half  blank  okay  zero  check  math  real  quick  make  sure  okay  talking  one  three  plus  five  le  seven  eight  plus  seven  plus  four  ten  three  point  six  ill  round  three  integer  oh  yeah  supposed  ake  split  half  basically  put  first  half  second  half  target  first  half  blank  yeah  awesome  yeah  okay  wanted  make  sure  yes  oui  oui  mon  ami  one  easier  class  far  kinda  fun  got  yeah  every  day  problem  right  oh  yeah  sorry  f  per  number  reference  okay  let  go  next  one  yep  killin  activity  b  one  worth  point  question  okay  like  one  like  yes  argument  array  type  value  argument  okay  yeah  reference  reference  value  past  method  semantically  best  described  passively  shared  yeah  tenth  b  b  number  yeah

when you finish today call me over and i will crosstalk  for you this is  hows it looking oh  aw dude i hate flow charts i find them to be ridiculous you said who michael no not me im sorry sorry oh okay whats up well yeah because were doing square rectangle triangle yeah that makes a lot of sense crosstalk  misspell the first word rec might be a little rough in this activity you will write a program that will prompt a user to enter  look they spelled enter wrong to enter thats rough should we prompt them a list oh no nevermind most likely and its dimensions the program will calculate the area of the shape should we ask them two different questions click that one yes thats a great help it adds this crosstalk  just automatically i figured that out a while ago inaudible  all right im saving it as a string is that correct save it as a string right char area crosstalk  oh crosstalk  inaudible  is c capital in char crosstalk  was the input dot  oh put an h im sorry can i look at that real quick oh dot  crosstalk  where does it  oh dot sorry im so rusty with this one i need to practice that crosstalk  then the second question what are the dimensions yes thank you thank you crosstalk  flow chart write four methods theres so much ways we can do this program without a method i just realized that but we have to use a method obviously in this crosstalk  public inaudible  are you using a double or a single a square it would be  public static and itd be void it wouldnt be  crosstalk  itd be a void one because were returning the variable inside the crosstalk  itd be a void wait did you declare square somewhere up there i spelled public wrong thats why i kinda feel bad for a person thats going to have to listen through all this its a lot of listening you have to initialize the scanner hang on trust me you know more of whats going on than i do yeah if the wait when does the method come in im still confused about that part i have another question im sorry after youre done let me just ask it crosstalk  false here crosstalk  here you have if crosstalk  youre just utilizing this crosstalk  down here and crosstalk  im just worrying about have you got the square part can you im still getting an error at the public static part where would it go im sorry would the if statement be in the public static name method its not like running a happy with what oh i saw that thats really cool im proud moving up theres also different settings you can change it all right i think i have it but its still picking up an error somewhere this is what i have it as i have shape r system of what are the dimensions inaudible  im using the same variables as i used here because you can redeclare  yes what is the  thats what it was then it goes int with equals input dot next int aww dang it now i messed up the code okay wait wait give me a second let me just fix something and then  did you do it like  yes perfect what did you say about redeclare area in each one wait that means just delete this one right here yeah initialize youre going to have it as a double yeah crosstalk  public static its height times base divided by two i was just thinking out loud about the area of a triangle dont judge are you on the circle one now you finished triangle what is the  i knew that okay base inaudible  were making the area double this time right areas going to be double okay i have another question actually wait no nevermind i think i just answered it that means in the public static instead of saying ant i have to declare as a public static double do you want to test it out together what see like that yeah okay well thats not going to be that hard to change it that means the input has to be double fuck im doing crosstalk  everything now is a double except square there it is all right whenever you want to test run we can try ready you want to test run it youre doing c whats your radius  lets try a rectangle rectangle crosstalk  to or just in case  times   whatd you want to use   okay wait i thought we did triangle copy and paste that helps im going to start on the second one real quick hey i have a question nick do they actually want us to make a flow chart you did or you didnt im going to talk to sarah and ask her because i really dont want to do a flow chart it sucks i hate flow charts i have to write a game for my c class were making a simon says game and its going to be over  lines of code its a actual game crosstalk  yes but the flow chart that we have to write is going to suck write four methods crosstalk  im going to  im just adding comments right now on mine just in case hey nick do you know if we can write it all on one code or just  mmhmm okay so its all the way in the back wait when is this thing okay wait when is this thing due just to double check about it whoa its due in  minutes  i clicked on the wrong document so now im going to have to  its number  right i think so yeah so it turns out that there is a  for our cplus plus class theyre going to give us a compiler that were going to use i think were using linux or something oh okay can you resend that email because when you sent it i think gmail was down and it didnt let me receive or send emails out almost done its due in  minutes let me just finish it real quick okay are you just going to ask them to enter a number why cant we just make an if statement that would be so much easier  oh wait okay enter i think well do input inaudible  to the next ooh ive gotta make it a double does it make it a double so how would i know if its negative i mean if its a  mmhmm oh i know what i can do okay so public  inaudible  hint oh nick can i borrow you for a second cause its due in  minutes i just have a quick question okay so im doing the part two for seeing if its even or odd this is so far what i got system out enter and integer that number input next and then this is my class right here or this is the public scan okay one second even what ive done is i just returned the integer modular two and then do an ifand or if statement of crosstalk  zero one okay so you did if  so itll be if what  where would the if statement go here write your thing and ill see it real quick equal to inaudible  of now  crosstalk  oh its  the number equals one and if its one its odd okay great crosstalk  did you run it and check it okay let me run mine real quick first four c five no seven seven is not great seven assignment crosstalk  okay im starting to like it you helped me understand it better thank you so much by the way so what do we  okay and then submit i need to talk to sarah about this no oh right now oh i didnt check im sorry but yeah that day the email wasnt working i couldnt send anything whats your name oh yeah not yet this is the first time i got this email from you the other these are just the subscore okay im gonna start this start sumner  thank you so much by the way awesome i have a question a quick question so i just submitted the assignment but i didnt submit the flow chart do i have to take the picture of a flow chart and submit it we dont have to do a flow chart right we dont or we do fuck i think so oh fuck i shouldve asked sarah yeah it sucks ass excuse me for my language crosstalk  oh dang i have to go swimming oh hmm the submission page im sorry okay modules where is it okay wait can you change the due date its due in like two minutes okay thanks i have no  crosstalk  whenever he comes back yeah tomorrows probably why im gonna go swimming im excited hey im still in class crosstalk  yeah its  i just finished the code im about to get out right now yeah i have to go back to get my stuff okay bye okay hmm oh yeah ask sarah crosstalk  what is an interesting  crosstalk  wait what how is your feeling toward your team positive i completely  willing to change my behavior completely forgot about that lets get that back up submit done  willing to listen and had selective attention wanting to participate and had inaudible  and willing to involve organize i checked all these hopefully thats not bad excuse me sorry oh i did that too i didnt realize it oh oh sorry dang writing a flow chart for a method i feel thats just gonna suck hey does the book talk about writing flow charts for method writing flow charts for method like is it different no okay two things is the change date gonna be  is this gonna be changed okay awesome and can we get unmiked thank you sure the flow chart the two mega flow chart for a method is it   oh i have a quick question is sarah not coming today okay i have something to turn in to her its that what is it called its the shape things that i was supposed to yeah that i mean i submitted it online i just want to okay you dropped something zero yeah oh my gosh sorry microphone its all good thats  the linked well  she explained it i think and according to what i read on whats this thing called stack over flow so like she said you do it on four and set it equal to the sentence link for it be a max and just keep going add by one until youve passed the sentence the link all right now she said you can do an if statement or a switch i did a switch so a e i o u and any of those are met you add one to the vowel the vowel is set at zero and if theres an i youll add one and keep going until we reach the sentence link and thats when it stops until i reaches that sentence link but im getting an error right here so its still something i dont know why hmm oh no no the i tells you what  let me see wow okay yeah okay oh okay all right one second i cant even find pole everywhere methods with the same open pole everywhere open pole everywhere come on come on come on come on come on come on on the plus side its one of the shorter questions ooh dang okay we can  i know i switched i wrote sirn and then i was like oh snap i know as long as  okay damn what has happened in this grid counter  i think its four or five yeah i did that too i think its four so that would be a four  index lets see what happens if i run it index four what oh the c the k oh crosstalk  youre printing out the k and the k is only initialed in the four statement youre supposed to print out the count not the k fuck the resistance is pain that was a trick question no me too crosstalk  shit man oh no i said shit cause i dont know which one it is i would have a guess but its a guess if  hey nick what did you put by any chance which one did you put crosstalk  i guess so crosstalk  why is … i guess so why is it not working wow i think i figured it out so you were right it wouldnt be link itd be character at that thats what it would be hey how many vowels do you see in here im sorry for interrupting how many vowels do you see here so its a and what else oh thank you i was looking at it i was saying words wrong okay i got zero tell me how it goes okay she wants it all to be in method right yeah yeah okay i think crosstalk  number equals number im a little stuck i got it to work right but not in the method yeah so this is my method right here how would i call it back again here okay i did that the vowels are right here is that what youre talking about the vowel so i would do ent count equals zero oh thank you i got it now okay lets see v cat course v cat okay the string has okay im just writing the pseudocode right now wow my pseudocode huh wow okay you can now use split method i was just reading about split method it has been a hell of a day well there goes one substrings what do you mean okay i think i know what youre talking about ow yeah im having a back problem right now it hurts yeah can i see how your flowchart looks okay yeah could you send that to me thank you so much good question no probably not no i was wrong how did you do number two im sorry yeah mmhmm affirmative yeah what would my method return back a string yeah its a nested loop so i do four this i equals i dont think im gonna know how to do the substrings im not sure if im gonna be able to do substrings ive never tried it i dont think so could do cloak on that ask him can we do substrings then that seems much easier but how would we put it in a method oh so i read this in c you can do two returns there is a way that it returns its code twice if you do it in a loop no im not sure but i read it somewhere if we can do the split way whatever way you were just talking about i think i can figure that part out can i take a picture of that oh not that the substring yes thanks thats not good there goes  dollars i have a ques never mind perfect it said you cant use a split but okay we cant use a substring okay then i think i missed the loop of before okay that still raises the question of how i return two different things what does this thing do okay couple minutes oh it would equal split equal to everything im seeing says use a substring okay ive got something but im not sure if its right hows it looking so far all i have is the two four loops and then thats it i think the easiest way to make two maybe two methods call them both inaudible  in one method says in a method of substrings yeah oh so you do public static void i have a question i was wondering is there a chance you can change the due date for  instead of  if thatd be possible yes yeah the due time to  to today midnight just a couple more hours okay thank you so much okay can you walk me through what you just did mmhmm affirmative sorry could you start from the top cause so you did public static void split okay string okay and after that what would you do length equals okay and then string second okay okay split and then so then first is equal to first index oh sorry first is equal to first is equal to first dot plus sentence sent one sent one dot chart at and then index at index or i  and then you close that four loop okay so then a would equal split oh okay since i already declared it less than length okay second critical second nope nope okay whats the inaudible  system out print line what about this part right here is there nothing in the main okay first  sorry for keeping you by the way okay sent yeah it equals to split and then oh this is so confusing i need to use better variables yeah the cat thats two into the string no two hell oh let me show you yeah okay that is that  now time to do the  whats this shits called flow chart okay cool i finally got it finished im just gonna submit it  yeah im just gonna submit the flowchart yeah my teammate helped me so much okay alright oh nick sent me his flow chart would you like to look at it because im about to head out right now ill finish it later okay yeah ill probably do the flow chart when i get home because i have swimming in  minutes and ive gotta get to my dorm and get my swimming suit on swimming suit swimming gear fuck i forgot something exit form thank you so much again for all your help youre coming on thursday right oh well good luck and have fun you finished the flow chart already yeah  if you want you can change array a dot length just to put size yeah because like  oh not less than or equal to just less than size less than or equal to size yes im so sorry link that ones safer okay because theyre declaring the size so thats what i did size i just did size thats what i did right there just put in size and then define the max as right there i mean to fill it in yeah dont forget ins so parentheses ins because i forgot that and i was like staring at it for a good minute careful calculate the average let me see no youre right youve got an open parentheses right here by the way put parenthesis at the beginning of math parentheses and then keep going times nine close parentheses nine because they would go use it from zero to nine sorry we all have those she wants the average im probably not gonna display the array oh yeah we should definitely display the array ill do the display the array im sorry and then you do my possibly yeah i think itd probably be in the same one yeah okay yeah this might be it output  yeah and then ill do int array equals my inaudible  okay lets see next inaudible  array okay all oh okay have you displayed it yet okay i think i just figured it out mmhmm negative here if this one works then no wait let me just take this out okay there it is wait let me leave a space okay and now it should be  theres the array yeah in the same one where we did yeah no print line just print alright send crosstalk  this is what i did i put that before the four loop and i just did that okay i pulled it up from my old code also when we get into  dimensional arrays or multidimensional arrays its basically the same thing you just add another four loop so its a calculate the average of all of the arrays are you good i believe so yeah yep yes mmhmm affirmative from the max its basically the same thing as a max except youre adding them yep no you want it to be in the four loop or outside i think it might work too but i have mine inside the four loop actually no youre right no yeah youre right average stays out yeah sorry i forgot to output the max  yes that is correct good eye okay yeah its definitely an integer i havent done a double new array is inaudible  beautiful which one are you on i just finished that one if you need help on it i just finished that one if you need help on it but it should basically be the same thing as the other ones theyre all almost identical shuffle oh that shuffle one might be a little rough array a crosstalk  what have you done okay lets see red light just inaudible  before you put it back well at a stretch its all so self explanatory crosstalk  the high values the high values its greater than average im sorry could you  cause this is going to drive me crazy could you press sensor right there right here between  yeah right there okay thank you you just write system output high average also thats not correct so you might want to do int number equals array i right thats a number not an array right there youre putting in an array let me see i might have arrayed it wrong find the average copy and tender array okay you are correct i am wrong but the system output when you output it you output it in the fore loop so it can run and i need to do that too cause i didnt realize that crosstalk  print um yeah also im not sure about the size of it cause it wouldnt be the same length as the other one  i apologize again lets see if it works okay it does not work the high value wait i think i had it right im going to try something crosstalk  high value high value equals i believe it says we have to same them to a new array  its much easier to print them than to save to an array or something thank you thats what i have here let me try it again i value equals array like that okay crosstalk  awesome were killing it i guess i know how to shuffle like the first one change the first one to become the last one  really we use the same numbers just different order i dont think we should run it in random random generates a random number so were going to generate another random number okay what no okay do we set it equal to the new one like do we make a new array or is it just the same array but we shuffle the things so crosstalk  i think i got it okay okay awesome oh wrong awesome now the mine is my arrayand this is probably going to be yeah just create another array your array so like we cant name it we have to name it target okay probably the first type of source array the second half of the target array yeah its the multiples i think i have an idea of it i hope so isnt it size divided by two target okay probably the first half of the source into the second so lets just cut the first half of the first array into the second half of the target array let it run there it goes so do i just generate the first half randomly how okay target equals target correct why did you do i plus halfway oh okay so then you write it i plus halfway okay how do we show the and then that equals array a is that size or should that be halfway mmhmm affirmative what im actually wondering is is it okay if it shows zero i guess it is so new array int target and youre right about size size divided by two four int a equals zero a is less than size divided by two a plus plus no no no no target is the same size yes target is size yeah yeah yes i think the zero should be fine at the top of there i have a cool question with the target array have you checked the math by the way on like this never mind i think the math is alright cause i can add up all my numbers and divide them so i can see my math just based on math im going to do this while we wait good work today lets go home its all done yeah arrays like you said i think were definitely going to use them everyday or mostly with everything hiya sarah can we get a mike im sorry right here literally under the section title  oh when a method returns an array the reference okay what question do i have an answer for oh okay inaudible  hey we got the question  right thats awesome i was worried about that one thats not good okay page  in the book when it tells you where the page is me too i found it so the argument is a reference of a  can be inaudible  same as the method same same as a ray being past yep that what inaudible  perfect okay inaudible  method follows the value of a thats initialize that ten and inaudible  and so the method of  is the inaudible  numbers one crosstalk  and a would be  there is no a wait let me look at it again yeah there is no a method then yeah okay back in the main method but after the inaudible  really okay so before the method is called alright a is placed in int num int and num equals  a is equal to  i think so okay bo i think its equal to  but double check that bo is equal to  okay what inaudible  into the method the values change in the method that value will also be updated in the name its worded weird whats up what page are you looking at of a permanent method lets see inaudible  passed to a method all the value will also be backed up in the method in the main inaudible  a wait whats a what question are you on im sorry okay really back in the main after okay that sounds correct from what i heard i think i have no idea okay so thats false alright so  is false and  is true passed by the reference write the output for the inaudible  pay attention to the spacing as well oh okay inaudible  carry the  okay the method does nothing thats what im confused about the one that says increase mine it does nothing wait i know it increased mine though something what about theirs i have an idea lets see okay i got it but i dont know how i got it i mean i ran it but i dont understand  and  but im not sure how oh so with mine it only adds  making  to  and with theirs it does nothing like you said making  with  wow yeah inaudible  by takes an array inaudible  i think i know  actually nevermind thats the one im thinking about cause  okay this one doesnt make sense at all yeah increased data doesnt return a value thats not true cause they both return a value increased there doesnt implement a value inaudible  the array i dont think that ones true i think the only one that makes logical sense is okay whats the difference between these  programs you may refer to  copying the arrays in the next question  okay so program and the value of list  are copied into list  yeah let me just look at  yeah its easy to get these ones switched up actually let me see the choices copies the reference of list  to list  there for if anything changes in list  or list  both this will update to be the same yes okay wait thats what i put for program one the values of list  are copied into list  the values of list  are copies into list  but damn thats hard okay can you explain your logic behind that one so i can understand it a little okay copies the reference okay awesome alright now lets see the method that you use to inaudible  the values of the inaudible  presuming the values of the array inaudible  yeah im reading the second choice you have first one is make a copy of the past array yep beautiful alright one more thats not fun  yeah me too i think mine mightve interfere a little okay activity  inaudible  working in an array is  define the array inaudible  okay yeah no i wrote this code before actually well string activity  inaudible  string name how many names no okay write a search method right put null enter the nums one plus two crosstalk  string and  equals the output line actually no equals  input  next line  yes you are very correct yeah im having trouble with my  loop i dunno why oh nope im having trouble with a  loop mmhmm affirmative im not sure why though enter hey name a input dot the name a input dot next inaudible  oh no hey could you look at this cause i cant figure out whats wrong with it okay so my strings named a i mean the string is named name a equals new dot next line scan oh sorry oh thank you fixed it okay uhhuh affirmative alright now thats filled out i hate searching for strings i hate searching for strings sort it i think im gonna use the other one i think im gonna use the other string i mean that search method so theres  one where it has to be sorted and the other one where its not thats the one im gonna use linear one linear yeah okay so its gonna be a public  where we returning an integer right int name search name oh see ya what is its  yeah thats what im doing if  names yous aid if name equals what yeah i just forgot how to write the equals part sorry if your first  if your  so a is the name of i equals how do you write that names dot equals this return i wait whats going on im getting an error right here it says the method must return a result yes no its inside the  loop that wouldnt make a difference oh it did okay if k is greater than  inaudible  search plus the index plus k q w e r t y u i q other thing q awesome alright it works did you actually put  names i just put qwertyi i just did q enter w enter p enter i dont think i can think of  names i dont even think i can inaudible  okay oh wow its almost class sarah whenever youre ready were ready yep  they had it you got to search for it by the way you have to go here and search for it its page  and something   give me a second let me find it yeah  bubble sword it has all the sword stairs  you found it youre on number  right  okay that ones a little something  all right so oh okay  okay so here pull up the graph real quick go to number   so the first one should be five three two eight and then the second one is three five two eight right and then to get the third one you switch the five and the two all right five then the next one will be the hold up put the eight yeah thats weird just leave it for now and then we can sort it out there we go just tab into it yeah okay and then the second one youd switch two and then three and then five no no not the two and the three im sorry yeah two thats two yeah im an idiot thats still three so thats three tab those two the other ones eight and then five and then give me a second so if you just switch oh no yeah im gonna pull it up yes my videos not working okay let me watch that could you go back oh nevermind okay so then this one will be two three five eight and then two three five eight wait no i think you have that one wrong wait no oh damn this is so confusing we get three tries by the way yeah so this is what i proposed this is my proposal three two five eight three two five eight two three five eight two three five eight thats most likely not correct but you should try something similar but different and then well see which one is correct oh man well if youre wrong then im wrong you need a space by them separate using a space only so it doesnt come out as wrong so wait it doesnt change anything okay okay check that six eight okay so then oh okay i gotcha so it would be two three five six seven nine eight three five six seven eight nine thats it come on please on my first try  out of  i have no idea are you serious what did you get for number nine and eight okay could you keep that up i mean i got everything right i mean i have them right here because you are allowed to look back at your old answers the text editor lets you do that you dont have to keep it up no more actually no no nevermind im good for now okay negative one zero wasnt sorted just checking has returned yup i got eight and nine those were my first choices but then i changed it because the answer before i put that it was a binary so now i was like okay its binary so its not in order man i wish they would keep my right answers so i dont have to go through all this the etext what do you mean wouldnt the book be considered etext nope bubble three okay two five eight three two five eight two three five eight two three five eight did you look at this see this group i really dont want to do this again selective sort aw i cant copy it i have to do these five eight seven nine six five two three five six seven nine eight two three five six seven nine eight one two three five six seven eight nine six eight eight nine eight nine nine nine so thats it i think beautiful yeah  you know at some point in my life i thought  was three plus six update  is not three plus six i feel like one day im gonna attach it to my necklace this thing should look good i think itd leave a mark cause gold is soft thats why back then people used to bite gold and if it left a tooth mark then its real banana banana banana  every couple of minutes im going to say it  banana hm  banana banana  man the person thats going to listen to this isnt going to hear banana several times theyre not going to want to listen to  anymore  are you serious no i havent looked at it yet ah it doesnt look easy it looks pretty its not too bad i dont know let me look at it define a two dimensional array in data and name it main array  what oh yeah i dont like it damn everyone says its easy but i dont know what part of it are you all saying thats easy its not hard but its not easy  yeah so prior peeling it i just call it by activity   deploying moo no no numbers dont have to be first what did you call it and ill tell you did you leave the space between d and array ah no problem wait what i guess so so for the  loop you want us to use arraylink instead of okay i get that okay define a  dimensional array that data type name it main array main array first okay second  i dont think so times  plus  i need to remember that one math not random okay times  plus  okay and there goes my array being filled  wait what how do we declare the size of the array who declares it no no no who declares it how do we decide what size it is is it randomly generated two random gen arrays between  and  to define the dimensions oh between  and    okay and now im supposed to fill the array ive got it now  dang there was something here that i read about a random generating  what yes so its times  plus  cool beans  actually no it goes row mmhmm affirmative im just right now storing the random values in the ready twist did you say mmmm negative i think its in int it says from what to what because i dont have it pulled up right now  its from  to  because the highest theyll go is  and then plus one is okay i got it oh yeah yeah youre right okay wait so why is this one  plus  and not  plus  this one why is it  plus  and not  plus  yes so watch this that will be from  to  correct yes and then i add  plus  ah okay i think so i have no idea this here the parenthesis that makes a difference oh nope  yeah i understand all right so there i have built up my array  fill the main array between  and  and then print array formatting for an example past two rows for the okay i got you now fill array and  so printed out its going to be that or equals  or mentions so stonehowprint line so print okay now lets see cal queue waiting i have  calculate the numbers in each column of the array and store them in a wait calculate average numbers in each column and store them in some variable guess what the data type should be when you store it shouldnt they be double okay all right int average equals  ah darn wrong one  column  average isnt that what weve been doing okay oh man  hello sum up right columns okay on the oh and then make  variables int total plus equals no main array row column divided by what what do you divide it by to get average divided by  by adding  were calculating the average in each column so divide it by column  by array array  okay i think i got it maybe if you get it tell me so i can show you mine and then we can switch out and see which one is which fuck  okay i think i got it the average for column  shit mine doesnt do it correctly it does something it just doesnt do it right  so this is what mine does console thats mine i dont understand where it got column  column  column  column  column  column  yeah so pump  oh thats it thats it what  yeah i know im looking at it yeah  get the sum of the first but i think i copied it wrong or something summing elements by column  what the fuck oh link i think ive got it linked i think that might do it i just want it to be column wow hey can i see how you calculated the average because  hm  yeah divided by rows okay so wait this is what i have could you look at it so thats what i have for the average here oh okay so i would do  yeah i havent got to that one yet okay  yeah oh could you  oh i cant could you move that yeah  so you did double average to find that in column whats this right here okay thats what i did is that correct or no or would that be outside the other one yeah okay  this one the total and i get the average by total dividing what i think so total divided by lets see if this works  would it be like that how come i keep getting an error linked oh nevermind okay let me run this real quick yeah thank you austin wait thats correct the average for column  is    plus yeah its  okay and then were just supposed to find the max  in the column  thank you how are you looking so far would the if statement go in the  loops  okay so itd go here fine where you are yeah yup oh how did you get the max average im sorry im still working on that one okay  okay and thats outside of the nested loop so if max average is greater than oh okay then max average equals  and then outside of all of that we print it out i think my column so        could you add this for me  plus  is  plus  is  plus  is  plus  is  plus  is   divided by       is not  good question here can i see has yours worked okay can i see whats you im not sure oh yup yeah youre right all right now lets check it one more time yeah whats up how come yeah theres nothing higher than  okay so here  this is my int average equals  right int column equals  column main array  link column then int row row main array linked row plus plus matrix row column total over matrixlinked so sum over that so wait what okay wait here what if i just put total inside my  loop like that me neither it looks exactly the same except that one part and in code its always the smallest part  ah yes youre right thats why yes thank you all right well time to submit this bad boy is that all we had to do banana banana banana banana banana banana  so i found out what i made on my lab exam   yeah i had to go ask her though because they havent been posted yet  this was activity  hey sarah can we get a mic whenever youre ready sarah  its all right can we get a mic  mmhmm affirmative yeah keynote  plus  is not  oh yeah and i forgot how you do method give me a second im going to look through this thing oh my gosh i didnt want to forget little details it sucks ill just look at previous activities i did oh i got it i was so close okay so lets do input import javautilscanner nope nope so its public static okay okay i got it i know it was like we do this it would help if i scrub the system and it fills it with user input should i fill the two dimensional array in the main method array how would i go about doing that in the main i mean in the yeah all right wait int i equals zero oh it goes arraylink right can i take a picture of that or what activity was that on actually okay ill just pull that up are you sure its activity  oh yeah lets take a picture of that and just do it call z several times  no i ran only one time so yes we do oh from activity    let me see oh im doing the wrong one oh no no no no fudge i messed up never mind activity  figure out,finish  today  call  hows  looking  oh  aw  dude  hate  flow  chart  find  ridiculous  said  michael  im  sorry  sorry  oh  okay  whats  well  yeah  square  rectangle  triangle  yeah  make  lot  sense  misspell  first  word

hell  day  well  go  one  substring  mean  okay  think  know  youre  talking  ow  yeah  im  back  problem  right  hurt  yeah  see  flowchart  look  okay  yeah  could  send  thank  much  good  question  probably  wrong  number  two  im  sorry  yeah  mmhmm  affirmative  yeah  would  method  return  back  string  yeah  nested  loop  four  equal  dont  think  im  gon  na  know  substring  im  sure  im  gon  na  able  substring  ive  never  tried  dont  think  could  cloak  ask  substring  seems  much  easier  would  put  method  oh  read  c  two  return  way  return  code  twice  loop  im  sure  read  somewhere  split  way  whatever  way  talking  think  figure  part  take  picture  oh  substring  yes  thanks  thats  good  go  dollar  ques  never  mind  perfect  said  cant  use  split  okay  cant  use  substring  okay  think  missed  loop  okay  still  raise  question  return  two  different  thing  thing  okay  couple  minute  oh  would  equal  split  equal  everything  im  seeing  say  use  substring  okay  ive  got  something  im  sure  right  hows  looking  far  two  four  loop  thats  think  easiest  way  make  two  maybe  two  method  call  one  method  say  method  substring

richard hoel  your number  im going to be an integer today keep it simple youre alone you walked right into that one oh this is unless hell opens up oh youll still hear it if not well just get louder yeah its okay weve got hours because were important what did you just say what did you say see i keep extrastrength stuff but i left it at the apartment today i usually keep it in my bag too i keep extrastrength advil and extrastrength tylenol all the time thats not bad while im working i mean the people playing football youd be surprised there were people that i played with that would take  before a game yeah its crazy i would wait until halftime to see if i needed it but i didnt take it before the game steroids i would have loved that i mean ive had eyedrops that had steroids in them but of course i mean were getting shit done no it was really tiny so i made it bigger see now you talked about me i got to make it small youve done enough youre done here okay hey hey hey all right now i think id enjoy that hasta never yes so i did public static do you own a pair of shoes tommy okay im cool i worry about inaudible  ah shes got that fetish you wanted in some people do swimming for one reason inaudible  get in the pool ooh youre always in last place exactly so were still on for tomorrow right and were we supposed to go to the gym yesterday did you go i completely forgot i can hear i could hear before you took them off oh im getting out of there you want to take over my lease i renewed and i dont want it cause were looking for a house now yeah i dont know thats anywhere you go youre not going to know about it you have them on your head yes yes i did are we doing uppercase and lowercase letters or just lowercase but thats not all of them but what if someones really angry and they type in all uppercase okay so were going to do that first a dot  you party pooper the hardest way possible i dont think you can nest switches you can so what is it that cant be nested no theres something that said that something couldnt be nested i remember that i dont read much but i read some things i remember reading that something couldnt be nested youre going to need your or button so youre going to have to copy that from somewhere no he had a great idea just before you go into it make it all lowercase and then get the letters out of it at that point cause its checking if its a if its e if its either one of those letters then its inaudible  she did say ascii code didnt she but it automatically i mean itll do the same thing here so if i take that out and just put the ascii code for a lowercase a it would do the same thing this is just a simpler way to write it a e i whats tomorrow im glad you guys know are we going to do the sometimes y or no really ive got more than that yeah you got to pay regardless i saw that all right lets run you out of town its got a reference to a nonstatic you takestaticokay see thats what i was trying to think of i just couldnt think of the word no she said that she said theres only five vowels a e i o u yeah she said that she said she shells does she have a she shed input the string the string has blank vowels one two three four five vowels enter lit it works yeah because you named it a down here when you pull it in its gonna pull it in under that variable it always tells me sudo is spelled wrong nope its just spelled differently this is america theres like four different ways to spell color color yeah hes thirsty no hes thirsty and the waters not enough see now youve got to go fill it up and do it again fill it up and do it again and get me one so we can race yeah thats not fair thats like an extra  or  ounces than that okay so its double the size nice more than double cause thats like     really holy shit yeah somethings wrong with them theyve got pneumonia by the end of that their lungs are full of water i dont understand that i wouldnt try it i value this life you know oh yeah you got to spin it around a little bit either that or cut a whole in the top or the bottom the bottom of the top we work well together what the second one well let me get started on it and well see what we can do hey man hey this is teamwork fucking shit i hate this no every time i try to go to new and then class my cursor goes a little too high and the new disappears i like to test it while im working do you use notepad or notepad i love plus plus so you never have to change the class is what youre saying makes sense makes sense thats why you guys are partners okay we get it its fine yes cause thats mmhmm affirmative well no youre increasing your i so your i is just your counter to keep the loop going your vowels is how youre actually counting the vowels yes substring substring wheres my cookie crosstalk  cause he doesnt want to damage his screen come on now so thats inside of the if yes its a nested problem problem dos underscore were not allowed to use it i will not uhuh i like my insides to stay inside i wont be attempting any splits ever yeah cause youre checking the character at the index of the counter i did the same thing for assignment  i did everything checking this way you have to do two flowcharts he got it done while we were doing the inaudible  he was multitasking hes got two keyboards so he just kinda im a set mine back up again i liked having that yeah for every you dont have to cause its already in that big parentheses so its got that one no this one in front of a thats going to be the big parentheses yep and then or and then all of that again just with e with that you just got to have it start somewhere else you can have it start somewhere else let me see what you got i love the visuals its amazing no no no it said we cant use split thats not in the instructions im sorry the instructionsspecifically specifily its raining outside guys huh but shes not here today we have to have a fallback im going to a different slide we cant use dot substring it says we cant use split but it doesnt say anything about ah so you want us to use a separate method can we use a split or that substring inside the method each word i did i just did if its a little bit yeah i enjoyed thinking outside the box has it been  hours again well can we get an explanation in five minutes i want to try it first and then she can come give us the answer i didnt try it with uppercase to be completely honest yeah it doesnt work i dont want to its bad because i kept deleting something i didnt want to yeah i dont know its not working i dont care about the uppercase yeah its not working for the uppercase so im just going to forget about it control shift what does it do nah like i wanna get this done guys why are you all quitting on me were just not ready to do anything and let you do it inaudible  you know i can see what youre listening to on spotify crosstalk  i can see what hes listening to i cant see what youre listening to oh wow nah its not the same person were still recording its okay well get there oh i dont have an ide open anywhere fuck this is gonna be like ten minutes crosstalk  yeah dude man that sucks im ready to make an array where theres a will theres an array where theres a will theres array wash your mouth with soap in my country we wash mouth with soap youre not being recorded everything is awesome lets not do that crosstalk  passive aggressive if you guys do that i said i might end up passive aggressive if you do that alright this is activity  where theres a will theres array random oh we get to use mathrandom again look at that what goes up must come down yeah you didnt know that its a good thing we didnt play the telephone game in this classroom yeah you really should not have eaten those nerds diabetes is a side effect diabetes inaudible  how many problems are there how do you not know its in the book you guys clearly didnt do the prework inaudible  so of course first were gonna import because thats what we do all the time and then you do open close square brackets of course this is java that was a really good one first im not a boy i am a man no whatd you ask yes i am so confucius my middle name is philosophy okay my middle name thats how i work yeah hey its not stupid you are its not stupid you are that was not nice i apologize you didnt do the prework did you i love you guys you guys are awesome thats why were friends with a user defined size you didnt figure it out welcome to th grade how you doing its for no he doesnt name it just giving the size come on you havent done anything you need to know it random between zero and nine size all right lets do this crosstalk  size and dot next you piece of fuck you forgot how to make a random number size equals n dot next n you got to do a four loop yeah because its in the book in the book its to print out all of it lets see if i can find it again yeah thats the wrong one yeah id like to see that one though here we go the following loop assigns zero to the first one one to the second one so well use four inti equals blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah got it so what this does is its going to loop through yeah this is the array because youll get the user input first and then make it into  so the reason  im going to declare my array after yeah so im going to declare my array after i get the user input where the hell did that come from all right int array bracket bracket okay hold on wow oh man no dont do that thats not nice so this is crosstalk  this is declaring the array and then this is initializing it so this just makes it now it knows its got its got  spaces that need to be filled up or have made they put in you have to do that int bracket in front of it whatever thats called there we go you got to cast it like a mold what do you need help with you need to have a  do you at least have the array no okay hold on its math well let me do the random first int random random equals math dot random bitch times  yeah max minus min its plus one yeah its nine minus zero yeah  and then its plus the minimum which is zero okay so yeah that works crosstalk  its not that bad hey hey every thing is awesome crosstalk  four inti four zero i less than  shit array yeah yes maam it is a control variable less length i have gotten very far crosstalk  see im still helpful trying to downplay my work crosstalk  everything is awesome equals  shit no i got to move that hey hey kim possible and ron stoppable what was his name did he have a name it wasnt skrat was it no thats something else he had like a persons name rufus it was rufus yeah he does are we going to print this out ah were going to do a lot of shit value by showing which means we do have to print it no just the value of the maximum so does anybody know how to find the maximum yes no maybe so so foreign language  so this is going to say array index of itll start at the first index is zero itll put a random number in hmmmhmm affirmative yeah everything is awesome foreign language  ive already got it filled i just need to get it  the other stuff foreign language  we got to find the index and  the value of the maximum lets see if its in the book its in the book page  finding the largest element really yeah i saw that ah its another loop fuck yeah the largest thats in the book too crosstalk  no this is a lot that were going to have to remember its going to update if its greater than  because we initialize it as at the first index its checking if its greater than the other one if its greater than what we already have it if is itll update it if not if will just keep going crosstalk  why did that not work the way its supposed to did i spell it wrong arr why not what the fuck did i do wrong what the hell maybe if i just try yeah but ive got everything as an n no it said it couldnt find it oh thats because its  i did a down here thats why its not declared until down there so ill just do it down here asshole four inti fives greater than  foreign languange  five is less than array oh wow its less than array dot inaudible  array i greater than  crosstalk  what is that after put it in the four loop itll print a bunch of different times the max thats not it though we got to find  you got to print the  you have to print the value and the index so where its at the index is going to be your i value crosstalk  what what happened crosstalk  oh you cant use the i value because its inside the loop no hold on put your hand down all we got to do is use a different  instead of declaring it look hold on wait dont tell them anything no no listen to me listen here bucko jesus dont speak jesus youre not listening i am trying to do the flipped classroom crosstalk  listen to me yeah you idiot whyd you put it in the loop hey hey no no no foreign language  use your noggin dude you might have to  well youll just put the  how are you print it in a loop can i see it you just put a  well you dont even have to do it all separately put it after that k go next to the k do print plus quotes foreign language  mine aint working yet let me see that i dont think my random is working mine runs its just not doing what i need it to do i thought you already took that fucker oh that sucks i got it so its the parenthesis its the parenthesis that i had to do right go ahead and run it crosstalk  index out of bounds out of bounds where did you  which on is that is that thats your max okay index equals one that one down there the second one thats not supposed to be there so where you have four index equals one semicolon one one go up its the four statement that second one yeah my random wasnt working its the parenthesis that are fucked up i went ahead and just did everything i did  minus zero and then plus one crosstalk  yup looks like its working its just weird that its always at the last index isnt it crosstalk  its always at the last one lets see if mines doing that i dont know it might be it sure is the only issue im having right now is its printing its always printing the last index im not sure if the max value  yeah well i dont know if it is but its always showing the last index according to the last index i think the random parts working its the crosstalk  i cant hear it in this inaudible  okay so the randoms not working not at all its just going crosstalk  its because i did it up here yeah i need to put that down here thats what it is its doing it every time right now its got a random value and its using that same crosstalk  yeah i had that issue before and i should have known thatll do it ill still declare it up there but ill initialize it down here just in case we have to use it somewhere else yeah but  one two three four  what the hell one two three  all right lets give it the benefit of the doubt the fuck kind of shit dude ridiculous ridonculous yeah and the index is still wrong seven might be the right one but its youve got a size of  what was your size five it only printed one two three four thats because the first one is five the index zero because thats what it started at right what are you saying no the size isnt an index the size is how many there literally are when you go from there should be five of them there but theres not because the first one isnt going to print yeah in that loop the first ones never going to print wed have to do that up here crosstalk  yeah so im going to have it print the first one because we dont take ls okay fucking piece of shit dude the index is still wrong i know why its doing it i just dont know how to fix it yet yeah of that value once it goes through the if statement but it has to check all of them crosstalk  its going to go to the end of the list huh what we can do is do a max index value and do what youre saying because i think youre right max thats why shit i cant get that out i have to declare you what mother fucker local variable may not have been initialized no it doesnt know what to do with it because theres nothing in it so im going to tell it that it starts at zero try this bitch again inaudible  at index nine okay too many i dont feel like counting that there is no index eight you piece of shit oh thats why i dont need the array index i need the index fucking idiot one two three four zero one two three four yes bitch ha zero one two three four yes sir it works we did it yeah thats why weve got four eyes on this four eyes two brains what if its an upper case l no with a finger and a thumb in the shape of l on her forehead it did and thats only the second part of the fucking  whats up man okay charlie lets do charlie actually lets not do charlie because im straight and  it could but  ive never met a female charlie i havent crosstalk  i think thats where my obsession with masculine names given to females started its even better when theyre extremely feminine and their name is i dont know charlie thats the best calculate the average of all the array elements random shuffling shifting yeah its going to be another loop i think its all going to be loops were going to have to add them all up and then divide by how many there are yes divide by the size lets do another four do the same four we did before five equals zero i is less than  i love it every time your screen falls over its awesome yeah it does inaudible  to sum equals array i plus equals  but were going to have to initialize yeah shit i dont need the sum to print we need the average im just going to use it in here well shit yeah i am going to need that outside of the loop youre saving me minutes i love it crosstalk  sum sum equals zero sum plus equals array array i thats going to add them all up right there then we can come outside of the four loop and take  well do int average equals sum divided by array dot link then print that out well fuck it i cant declare it in the print fuck bitch five four six three thats why crosstalk  you idiot shit what what the fuck is going on type that you piece of corn lets try this one more time im going to type exactly what i just typed its talking about the operator less than or equal to i didnt type less than or equal to thats nowhere on my screen my friends tell me i drink too much but i dont think so you know i think i handle myself pretty well no im fucking with you i dont drink that much crosstalk  buy an  pack a week thats all i think i know what i did wrong piece of fuck i just deleted all of that yeah i think i typed the system dot print inside the system dot print are you all done sir yeah pretty much i have to part e and f i got d done its not very easy i know that says who where does it say that see i just didnt  i just didnt read that far nine plus three is  plus eight is  plus four is   divided by four  yeah thats it theres a lot of parts to this see they make us think its not a lot of work by making it one problem you said e we got to finish d first look we just got in the tunnel we cant be looking for the light yeah were halfway through with an empty tank of gas i got to do comments so i know what the heck im looking at three size input watch that be way more complicated than a loop all the slots dont have to be full uh uh people with one car buy houses with three car garages what you use a garage to store shit no of course you can we just havent gotten that far yet dont be afraid be very afraid the loop thats the people that come around knock on your door threaten to kill you they threaten to kill you if you dont pay up at all values of array  yeah c is much better no it is not the words are shorter c is not hard at all instead of typing system dot out dot print line in c its c out to get something from the user its c in no it is not its the letter c and in you might be gay i dont know values of crosstalk  look its not a flying fuck its a flying saucer full of fucks okay inaudible  determine crosstalk  whats you going to do at home youre not going to do the work might as well stay home and get it done you cant do it here huh crosstalk  we too good for you aww im sorry crosstalk  aww burn i got a membership to planet fitness crosstalk  no planet fitness i got a membership i got a black card theres a planet fitness right down here a little further down university  boulevard i drive but i drive all right no because im in university crossings i just drive down to the gym uh uh but you said its right next to  yeah oh okay i ride my bike i dont have a parking pass thats why i wanted to be so close because i didnt want a parking pass yeah its still too much that wouldve been real nice like shut the fuck up e sort of chanting going on in the library im like are you kidding me right now can you imagine if there was something going on like that here at burger king yeah we see you ive got a test tomorrow youve got to avoid stressors i cant avoid work crosstalk  so i drink instead oh man i need to go there crosstalk  i think thats a little  its gotta be if its not descendants then theyre doing too much thats not cool at all cause im here paying for my education but youre paying for something you did long time ago thats nothing crosstalk  that has nothing to do with me i wasnt alive laughing i dont think theres a time thats not confusing alright no were gonna have a next class touche i dont know i kinda show up and disappear this shouldnt be too hard for them its a higher values than the average alright this is gonna be another loop whispering holy fuck okay lets think about this okay yeah i dont think we need three loops yeah yeah find the inaudible  that have higher values than the average so its gonna be the same for loop start at zero you wanna check all of em for inti equals zero i is less than array  mmhmm affirmative i dont need it cookout is comfort food mmhmm affirmative to talk about race woosah so were going through the array one by one and this is where we have the if statement if  if array  index or i greater than average then  we are going to  copy them into a new array named high values so first you gotta create the array so lets go outside of the for loop crosstalk  and create the array int  i values  you have to initialize it yeah new  lets see if i can get this right new int  new high values  no fuck i cant remember int array equals new int size okay yeah yes but its gonna always go into the same  well we can put it into the same index cause its gonna be the same size so we can do  how do we put it in array i  equals  not array i crosstalk  itll be high values equals  array i so that well get the number thats actually in there not just the index cause if we just do i then it would give us the index of that high value but it wont give us the value of that number so what this is gonna do its gonna go through an if yeah so if we use these numbers if index one  well lets see crosstalk  average is six so index zero will be greater than the average and the high value zero since were still at zero  nine and then go again reach eight and then itll be at index zero one two greater than average so the index is gonna be two your array is gonna be eight so were gonna have empty space yeah laughing who was sitting next to us um his last name is scallion chase there we go yeah yeah toby thats an easy one nicotine lets see if i can figure that ive got him on snapchat to ask yeah its like that sometimes i think its  might be isaiah cause theres toby isaiah eber  i dont know who eber is okay and then emily thats the girl that sits there mmhmm affirmative laughing name your high values so i guess after all of that we can print high values and ill do that in the for loop not in the if loop just to check it i dont know itll print so itll update it and then itll come up here again and itll print it but we can do it afterwards too either way i think would work but it might be better this way print line  high values  high values i  yeah that works next values nine at index one it sure is but theres two nines and i dont get how the average is five okay and nine and nine are greater than the average see we did that with one loop well if its in a loop it is technically a loop its an if loop yeah if is a baby loop for is a actual loop if is a loop just cause somebody said it was part  e echo im doing it just for my sanity cause i wouldnt know where one thing ends and one thing begins and if i wanna go back and say oh we did something that we can use before im like okay now i gotta look through all that  yeah so this one is  woo declare new array high values and he had help he said he used three loops he had help that says a lot part e shuffle all to the elements up to inaudible  do not have to shuffle space and just rerandomize the values this is going to kill me okay cant we use a loop for this i feel  lets see if theres anything in the book i feel like i  yeah random shuffling randomly reorder the elements i know that this is called shuffling for each element randomly generate an index and swap i with j as follows for inti equals array that length minus one minus one fuck it i is greater than zero i minus minus generate the index randomly with zero  j mapped at random times  not sure i understand that oh i didnt know she was still here zero one j i oh the random number has to be between  its less zero less than or equal to j less than or equal to i j has to be less than j has to be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the length basically okay i understand it now so what youre doing is for every  inti  crosstalk  this is all of the indexes yeah this is all of the indexes so for a list of  this will be  cause the index starts at zero so  and then while its greater than zero cause were working our way backwards go  intj get a random number that is between  its getting a random index number and then its gonna swap the  i dont know why theyre using a temp well i do know why theyre using a temp theyre gonna swap those two index numbers basically cause well take a temp put i in the temp and then put j into i and then put i back into j okay that makes sense you got it yeah we gotta make it just to hold it cause if you   put something on top of it then the first number disappears alright so it all makes sense for inti  equals  all of the indexes so array dot length minus one while i is greater than zero  then were going to work our way backwards i minus minus bracket bracket so were gonna get a random number a random index so itll be int im just going to use  i dont like all this i j bullshit random integer random index so i know what the fuck im doing yeah i gotta know whats going on random index equals  we got a typecast int mapped at random yes we are you can missing audio from  until   zero zero two and three one going back into a so a is going to be one was not returned so a is still ten so for four a is still gonna be ten zero no i mean its yeah so its gonna update cause javas an asshole like that and they wanna confuse everybody that writes it its got really big eyes it can see a little further i dont know yeah so five is false but six is true wait i dont know if its true for all objects but cause i saw it somewhere honestly more power to you crosstalk  oh shit i feel like im in a bowl of spaghetti all this stuff around me yeah i got this going that going i have to plug this into this too much way too much going on this one next to your feet i dont know my power save came with one yeah its a little power hungry so whatd you learn share with us bet i love it give this boy a raise lets just chalk it up as java sucks and get on with it wait whats seven  space five crosstalk  so its one t one space five is that right one t one what the fuck is  one t one guys its one t one i dont know where yall get this weird language yall are speaking but  what the hell aerodynamics are all on that you missed by a mile seven is one t one space five its one t one space five yeah one t one space five everything is awesome crosstalk  its still stuck in my head david slip again crosstalk  i didnt hear a word you just said crosstalk  im still looking at question nine im just gonna go change offoh thats easy so what what does one do yeah of course would you like a couple jolly ranchers too no am i the only one here that likes jolly ranchers green apple yeah well did i tell you when we used to make jungle juice we used to make jungle juice in a big giant one of those tupper ware things that you put clothes in thats okay thats okay no we used to put all of that crosstalk  we put all the alcohol sprites juices and then we dump then we would dump two pounds of jolly ranchers in there and let it dissolve everything whatre you talking about really jungle juice isnt supposed to have a flavor its supposed to be dangerous yeah well you see i just drink it so that i pass out i just drink to have fun what do you usually drink for so basically thats all i need im good thats all i need did you get this question one there it goes yeah reference and same what of an infant crosstalk  well ill stay away from that one im glad we know more about alcohol than we do about java crosstalk  beautiful awesome crosstalk  and then youll be asked for the activation code for windows which one the reeses or the jolly ranchers jolly ranchers you want one what is it four people thats it thats all just four people one of those inaudible  things crosstalk  yep im not getting any of it so weve gotta make a string array get  names from the user search it crosstalk  alright guys are you ready to do this yeah its disgusting its not good crosstalk  we made ginger ale in high school crosstalk  ive never done that made ginger ale in high school once and of course  no i love ginger ale but of course some of us wanted to taste the ginger so crosstalk  yeah crosstalk  i dont know anything about well the first thing that comes to mind for me is monks monks yeah thats about it is it suffering or is the yeah no material things its due at  and its like crosstalk  inaudible  dont remember it hey where you going we gotta make a string array put  names in it and then search it yeah just that one something to do crosstalk  oh yoga i enjoy yoga were inmates inmate  were all wired shit shit shit crosstalk  shit god process of looking for a specific element i feel like that could be so many different words search searching is a process of looking for a specific element im just thinking of stuff i mean it could be any number of things im going to say search and well see how that goes searching is the process of looking for a specific element inaudible  works for me oh no well no because eventually they have to roll it back up later three is linear so were going to go with sequential search im just going to do searching capital s look man this is not english yeah and then linear and binary and then linear again lets say inaudible  looks like this inaudible  going mainstream arguments we just did this didnt we hold on now mystery oh we got to look back up crosstalk  it looks like this starting with eight crosstalk  is eight in there eights not in there okay cool crosstalk  now were looking for six six is three right no i dont think so no slow your horses it can if i shoot him in the leg crosstalk  what does this perform crosstalk  no idea yes no six is three seven binary you move fast why did you get the answer above yeah yeah its going to return the index of it crosstalk  where did it go searching stuff mystery inaudible  what is okaycrosstalk  what about inaudible  yeah thats what im thinking binary crosstalk  what the fuck does this even mean step one i mean what am i supposed to get from question because six is at index one so that index of one is whats returned yeah oh hey choose the correct process for each step i mean where the hell is step one hey guys hey group group group hey group people what the fuck is question  asking me for question  eight what how is it wrong mmhmm affirmative yeah       i mean this has oh well yeah because its even theres the middle would be three mystery method where does mystery method start at did you guys use the mystery method somebody give me something to smoke we can go to the apartment if we really want to ive got a nice little toy to play with oh no ive got a nice little ive got a bowl i just bought a bowl because i dont know how to roll well now that i have the bowl i dont really need to ive been smoking for years but ive always been around people that rolled for me so i never had to learn yeah its crazy yeah mmhmm affirmative cant beat that taught him how to break it down itll be legal by then hes going to be so sad or hes going to get arrested yeah i know what is question  asking us were doing that okay yall are so sensitive yep inmate number i forgot already  im  so im  okay so im inmate  government name is jim bob billy bob joe jim bob billy bob joe dont forget the joe yeah so its joe jim bob billy bob friends just call me j thats im going strictly time im going strictly time i really need to go ahead and do it but i havent so i need to talk to my advisor what the fuck whoa i cant grip it hes got three of them it was in the vending machine in fretwell thats our jobs collectively yes so eight just changed eight is negative one crosstalk  so that means nine has to change guys weve scared them away do it crosstalk  can we just close this and  hot box the room crosstalk  have you not seen have you not seen neighbors have you not see neighbors what was it the second one where they crosstalk  its the number after nine before  its what she was doing up there before so we have to go through every step would you like a peanut butter cup i mean you got to work your way up wait did you all just get  is that what were doing here youre stuck on lucky number  ive seen it before but i used to know but i dont know anymore oh because it starts in small groups at a time or you can just counterfeit the passes and but then they six figures may be seven figures to them go go go go go ive played football crosstalk  assuming an array is already sorted which search method is more efficient for finding the element in an array i was an outside linebacker but an outside linebacker is more at least these days is more like a down safety so thats what i want to go to i want to go back like if i start playing here im going to running back and im going to be running through people like yeah and i cant gain weight for anything ive tried yeah its impossible so  oh im saying binary i mean we get three chances i dont know if it will it probably wont i believe your statistics but we wont learn anything that way because thats whats in the book and the book is supposed to be correct i dont know im on  the smallest number drops it with the first number yeah because thats what she did earlier then its done youre a bubble sort that is very uncomfortable we call that prolapse im sorry you had to hear that were not supposed to know were inaudible  we wear that thats the bit exactly pretend to be a professor just to crosstalk  multiple and neighboring for  correct multiple and neighboring for  correct  multiple and neighboring is that correct is anyone completely sure about number  look look here hey hey multiple and neighboring okay multiple and neighboring guys guys guys weve never heard of merge so its not the answer no he just looks really comfortable it was a great day today so yeah and he took full advantage of it i didnt thats okay i was at bars at like   guys we have to crosstalk  because its due at nine winner winner chicken dinner crosstalk  wait what are you guys how do you guys not have nine and  yet oh okay yeah we all skipped  oh so yall did everything already whats  and im guessing you guys skipped  and  selection mostly the latter whats inaudible  no yeah it inaudible  it was it wants you to go through and write in what the array is going to look at look like             and         it doesnt change anything crosstalk  oh that did change it to      and crosstalk  swap those this is a start swaps with  crosstalk  and then three over and over come down look at the five go crosstalk         crosstalk  looking at the first one looking at the second one looking at the third one looking at the fourth one swap those       this is not working four      crosstalk  ive only said that a million different times but its all right no one listens to little old richard over here crosstalk  yeah its okay they just dont listen to reason its a brick wall over here i thought i it tells you its wrong it just doesnt its wrong crosstalk  i did the last one  whatd you put i put searching for one and the answers arent already in wow that sucks number eight i think we already changed it yeah we had already changed it wait you said one was what i mean four was what crosstalk  four is one five is negative one six is three seven binary negative one nine the last one ten we skipped eleven binary twelve smallest crosstalk  first crosstalk  multiple neighboring crosstalk  bubble sort crosstalk  skip  sixteen selection and  did you do  did you do  i did  you guys are fucking deaf god i dont know i didnt do the other i didnt do  crosstalk  i didnt do  or  let me hear  again no hes right asshole             im missing the six so theyre all missing the six im missing the six hold on damn it asshole yeah i got to do it again crosstalk  i dont know about i dont know yet seventeens got to be redone because i forgot the six toby whats three man fuck this i dont care about  no more because its not going to come back its not going to bring back six all the way across from crosstalk  go back up to  yeah we got the same crosstalk  yeah were missing the six crosstalk  fucking hell i did because i dont think its going to finish it because its going through each of them no dont do that what are you just doing the six at the end dont do that i know im starting over if going through each index and checking if its higher or lower than the one next to it no its not thats not what its doing yeah seventeen was wrong because six was missing no it goes here and then yeah i knew i was wrong crosstalk  you telling me its going to move the five back to the beginning thats not sorted crosstalk  yes it does thats not any kind of sorted crosstalk  it does say we are now done sorting so it kind of have to be sorted yeah thats even more fucked up than it was before thats stupid shit though theyre working on it up there guys well see what they end up doing crosstalk  because nothing works the way it supposed well it works just not the way its supposed to crosstalk   nine  weve got two almost  well she corrected herself  assholes  yeah ive already gotten started  i had a new it was open  youve got to stay on top of things  shit you i said you oh ive got the th off well not the whole day but like we talked about i got after  i put a time in and they accepted it  thats what i did i put in woodward hall when i got up to walk out my phone was buzzing it was because it said it was delivered what kind of bullshit is that so i dont know i win in that situation its okay look it says woodward hall charlotte north carolina  bastards but im going to go ahead and order again the same exact thing i just ordered except this time im not paying anything  yes  mmhmm affirmative this is right around the corner  yeah dominos king tut you know where thats at  so if you go out the front of campus  make a left yeah  its right up the road  north inaudible  no i didnt  but i cant do that what am i supposed to call them they have my number i dont have theirs  well i dont have a driver yet so i cant do that right now im sure the wing place is going to be happy theyre making the same exact order a second time  and theyre getting paid twice so all right so ive got the array and the dimensions that should be full so lets see if i can print it out now  but they both have the same number though theyll both have the same random number i mean i know it will ive tried that for something before theyll both have the same random number  well times  mmhmm affirmative  for each iteration is what hes saying what im saying is its going to put the same random number in row that it puts in column  these things are really weird but its okay ill print it and see what happens  im just now getting print format down can we go slower guys this is a lot of shit  but im not getting enough credit for that  i need a little more credit for that  theyre too expensive i did that this past summer so i didnt have to pay my loans back i think we talked about that  june of   yeah they told me i was going to have to shave mine i was like no im good  i havent gotten that far i just want to print the array and see if its working right  i see it im about to do it right now less than the array  plus plus  horrible  bitch  array  piece of shit oh there it goes it works i did it guys mine works im doing it im a badass i got it im superior  yeah well be making the matrix next  no well make it an endless whatever you want to call it a forever loop  infinite loop infinite array infinite loop itll just keep printing random numbers  because it looks cool  the beginning of a scientific movie  the screen saver thatd be nice people would think youre a hacker and youve just got stuff running i done lost the assignment i dont know where its at anymore there it goes thats a completely different song i dont know what song that is  really i was singing let the bodies hit the floor yeah yeah you know it  i used to power lift so you know  ive got to have the rock on either rock music or eminem or lil wayne  drop the world is my power song ive got to have drop the world blasting  drop the world is my goto for heavy weights ive got a video on youtube where i was dead lifting something it was a lot of weight i was dead lifting and the first time i tried it it didnt move  so i had to change the song and i put that song  im pretty sure it was that song so mine acts up right now but it works ive got to close the work space and start over its really slow  random everythings random  everythings random the next one was random too  i dont know if its one two three four five six seven eight i hope its doing the right stuff because the math inaudible  random kind of got a little confusing for me  yeah thats the whole whatchamadoozy hullabaloo lets not put it in there lets move you over here to that and do it that way that works  what  two by two  if they dont deliver my wings this time im fighting somebody  thats what its saying estimated deliver   thats not going to get here at  i know that already so next is calculate the average of the numbers in each column store them in some variable print the average of all columns  then find the maximum  so the maximum average is going to be whichever one is the highest out of those  yeah not quite the average of the columns  no  no you dont no  hes talking shit and he wants to get knocked out thats all  yeah but ive got to get some wings and i was told  minutes and then i was told five more minutes and then i was told seven more minutes and then i was told it was here and then i was told it was delivered but i didnt have chicken wings in my hand  so if this same chick shows up with my chicken and she doesnt have the first bag i might lose it  i dont know  they havent gotten that far yet  but if it is  i know but the estimated delivery is not  instead of  so well see well see what happens all right guys anybody got the average numbers of the column and the sum variable and did the whatchmadoozy with the hullabaloos oh were behind  yeah its nested four loops its saying in the book page   you got it see now im like double hungry because i was expecting to have food by now you know how that happens  im double hungry now  yeah  the crosstalk   oh so you did it already  something i crosstalk  nesting four once again its max minus min plus one plus min its plus min  oh so this whole class is just a lie i understand its okay  so these should really be eight not nine eight plus two because itll be nine minus two which is seven and then plus one thats eight and then plus  seven plus one so eight then plus two nine minus two plus one plus two for some reason where that plus two matters i dont understand it  yeah and its placement is important for some odd reason like i cant just put eight  nine minus two  so you can do that nine minus two plus one you can already so its eight  yeah so what ive got mine as is math dot random times eight plus two  because for some reason you have to have that plus something math dot randoms an asshole  no you have to really pay attention to it thats one you will want to count and see if it has nine or whatever one two three four five  yeah you fill it with one to nine but its size is two to nine   what do you have written its nine plus two  its nine minus two its max minus min  how to do what compare them  well they wanted us to save it in variable  just because i dont feel like looking at the book let me see your loops for getting that average that you got  thats a fire a truck  first responder theres not really a fire its okay see because in the book it did it where they printed it out  it is  i want to print it like it is on the assignment sheet the assignment sheet has it printed next to each other  so you record each one  let me  lets try it  so you said it did work the averages were correct  yeah do it again and see if you can get a smaller one nope not any smaller  crosstalk  nine nine  six eight six two one  divided by one two three four five six  that is way wrong  its double  why is this in tablet mode im not using it as a fucking tablet here we go again michael this time  i hope so  because if not im going to kick both of them in the ass  what song is that  never heard it  i listen to a lot of different stuff  let the bodies hit the floor is a big one for me  i might know what youre talking about but i dont know names too well well see when i was lifting heavy i was using smelling salts too the ionium the stuff that firefighters and stuff have not bath salts its the stuff where like if you pass out in a hospital they put it under your nose and you wake up  oh its awesome though it is some awesome stuff  i dont think ive heard that either  yeah ive never heard that before  google academy yeah google fucking academy multidimensional array column average  i know that one yeah i know that one  thats an awesome song  yeah i mean i dont know the names of a lot of songs once it starts playing especially if ive got preworkout in me yeah im lifting everything i can get to i think x is rows yeah  because on a graph x goes horizontal y goes vertical  mmhmm affirmative x is this way  im going to print lets see because i dont know because now youre confusing me and i thought i was okay right but im confused as shit now  why you fucking with me like that you pice of  bitch there with go im already doing that youre too slow  well thats awesome  oh no im trying to get his attention because we were trying to figure out which was what and how the things oh look he actually called this time see hello yeah you outside  ill be in the front of the building  he looked like he was just out he had somebody else in the car with him  if you hit it hard enough  so we have to create new arrays  so youve got the running totals youve just got to save those running totals  all right  the same way we did it before  i mean weve only done it already  i just need the loop to get the average do you mind sending me that loop whatd you do you deleted everything  nine     divided by one two three four     divided by five no one two four  divided by four  that works  ive got to make my averages  you all are just going to destroy my charger  there are none back here why cant we have wall outlets like normal classrooms  wants to be extra and shit  you dont know until you try  no its not it stopped  asap  i know i just say asap this is not a doctors office we dont say

picture from sitting here  i lied i cant i dont have a digital zoom that sucks i had a bad phone before  i get those goosebumps every time  okay thats useless crosstalk    so what is the display for  crosstalk    okay  crosstalk    so thats putting in the random zero and one crosstalk    crosstalk  okay that makes sense and then it displays it and then it prints  so after that display you just need to put instead of a system outprint line you need to put crosstalk  line or a basically a prompt so  inaudible  or press enter that way itll pause in between  crosstalk    just got to figure out

no its anonymous youre a number and  damn i feel like we got to be closer this thing is gonna fall off i feel like its just gonna fall off hold on we can put it back here thats true but see its not on the floor here well put it on this thing thats perfect were good crosstalk  that was a really aggressive and weird week okay well now we have to finish making inaudible  inaudible  weve got  minutes left and theyre still passing these things out just because sarah didnt come start the activity i mean hey yeah just an idea just an idea damn just shoot yourself down well really i was just saying man you just shot your own self down just put yourself down like that positive selftalk is key now i havent been to therapy in a while if you cant tell oh damn i just took it out of my bag too i had a whole bottle of ibuprofen i put in my car i asked my manager from advil from the little first aid kit he literally gave me four packets theyre all mg no thats not bad i was like bro you really tried to give me this many mg of advil it was fine with me i might just fall out whatever oh yeah my sister was prescribed  at one point for her arthritis cause my mom was done with the biological stuff and they were just trying to manage her pain yeah she was eight years old taking that much ibuprofen thats fucking insane i mean its better than the steroids they had her on though i took steroids in rd grade for my fucking eyeball i had those and pills it was fucking insane im pretty sure thats partially why im fucked up because the amount of medicines they put me on this is totally related to what were doing i feel like theres got to be a different way to do this man why is that shit so large you forget your glasses today well no it just it just looks like the old people texts it wasyou know there we go we can find you a walking stick too if you need it are you having them input this string in the main method okay oh and youre just calling the method and the system and the printline yay i was gonna say i saw him wear closedtoed shoes one time i know ive seen one pair i think it was raining that day or something really thats true crosstalk  but do you only have leather flipflops because wouldnt that turn your feet brown in the rain that shit aggravated the hell out of me thats true i mean but the bottom of your feet arent brown ive never seen a person with actual brown feet on the bottom ive seen a lot of feet because i used to be a swimmer yeah swimmers are weird i did it just to see the feet that was it so i can see the feet oh my god next time i swim im not going to stop thinking about feet wow i learned something new about myself today did you have the method return an int value yay oh cause youre doing the upper and lowercase oh make the whole string lowercase that makes sense what do you need the or for oh she was saying something about the ascii code though everything she was saying sounded so complicated i was like theres got to be an easier way to do it thats true it tells you on the front page she said theres only five vowels cause i had the same question i have  for what teacher the teacher said the teacher the she shells did you put a littleoh you called it string a oh that fixed it because it was saying i couldnt use the strings gotcha and then you make it all lowercase two lowercase america color hmm chug chug probably probably so do weoh yeah we makezero thats what i thought and then the conditions are in the forloop you did vowels  yeah cause youre increasing it until the end of the length right and thats where i need the or thingy i found the or thingy so were good to go were good to go on that i i havent even tried its probably not that hard i could probably do it points so did you do vowels  if it was one of the vowels its inside of an if inside of a for yeah thats what it says is it character at i is that what you use true of course it is you have to do a flowchart for two so did you write this and then do an or and then write it again and then put it all in a big parentheses you dont have to oh its already in the brackets oh so you just and then you did or a differentokay what the fuck yeah thats what i said i only trust sarah a e i o u did you have an elsefor too or did you just or did you just do the if do you inaudible  for my code its not getting the uppercase ones even though i did two lowercase i dont know why cause if i enter i am happy whatever it only counts two but then if i run itmy happy i dont freaking know see it counts it right there did it do that for you should we just add all the uppercase ones we could do crosstalk  i really dont like him i want to smack that gum out of his mouth its just so aggravating crosstalk  i have a big issue with arrogance was that a good or a bad fuck bruce springsteen   okay crosstalk  too much is going on im so stressed theres too much going on there is so much going on okay i cannot oh puns this shit real as fuck though how did we know were all managing i mean if we need to pull out a list of microaggressions oh yeah you said what can we do all this in one class do you think i dont want more than one class right now theres array array fill the array with random integers find the maximum value of array value and index what whats a cry very good theres one problem but theres one two three four five six parts in the problem which was explained but i couldnt really hear cause there was a lot of shit going on so were only making one array what are we importing are we getting scanner import i mean cause it says so youre making how many elements oh so we arent getting scanner import actually aw shit this is stupid so the size of the array is decided by the user you are so confusion is it richard philosophy this is stupid i know but its also stupid i know but its also stupid its all good what the crosstalk  user defined size crosstalk  so is the user also naming the fucking inaudible  just giving you the size so how do you  i guess its an integer shuffle how would you make it the desired size of the  a four loop you put the users  kind of but isnt this right here the actual array but how is it calculated in the length if the length is based on the user input so how do you take that the size and then make it the yeah i have that and i have that variable but how would you make that variable the size well probably do it at home do you put the inaudible  in the bracket thingy with the crosstalk  i have no idea no idea do you put the size in the bracket what crosstalk  i just asked a question i dont know whats funny thats the point its exclusive yeah that makes it what the values are right yeah yeah yeah okay casting type casting you got to cast it mold it the random is what its a times  times the random plus one right so its zero to nine so its what nine  so the loop is what you do to create the random values for however many they decide crosstalk  oh man my microphone should go right here there we go the length thats just like the control variable right thats what that shits called links crosstalk  equals random  how do you get it to make a different random variable its impossible nothings impossible

stoppable he lives full time in rons pocket yeah well it didnt say to print it it just said to fill it then it said to find the maximum calculate the average all of them index of that value so that is just kind of like the index dont forget your shits touch screen is it saving it into the array thats how we call it whenever we wanted  we just type it with the brackets if we were going to call the array i guess is that what you call it calling it crosstalk  so random we also have to print out the index the value of the highest number im just curious theres a whole array of method api whatever mabobber in this because there was one that was like you can have it copy array or array dot copy or some shit like that so theres  which well be finding the largest the max is  crosstalk  why doesnt it start at one though for the max what if the value at zero index is crosstalk  value i dont know it says that shit is double see if you do a type cast or some shit if that changes it oh it could find it array fucking rude rude crosstalk  so its a four loop with an if condition should we put the print line right in the four loop or outside of it the print line like to print the max would you put it in the four loop or after the four loop every four loop yeah crosstalk  you have to print the index thats what i was trying to figure out thats going to return what the value inaudible  index is right so we have to somehow  thats what you feel like you look like thats what you say you look like oh my god yeah mine wont run i dont know whats wrong with it its saying theres something wrong with my if statement i dont know whats wrong with mine though crosstalk  i dont know when i run it it keeps making this thing its highlighting this every time i run it i dont know whats wrong with it index  which one is what i mean the random which one what line this line if four oh that should be index ah damn what the fuck so the random is what you said is not working because its just zero you had to put it in parenthesis i mean that could be correct but i dont know crosstalk  thats really weird i reel like its got something to do with the loop its going through to find the max is that what yours is doing yeah whats wrong with it i didnt even touch it oh i did i wrote  right here on a random line what the fuck howd i even do that crosstalk  so  index is one index is less than the length of the array its saying the max is always the last value yeah thats what were doing and then see would you just put that in the four loop where youre doing the random numbers so it prints it all out i guess thats how we find out how are you having it printed did it not print it at all a a a  so that its doing that every time its not for every  okay because thats what i was asking when i said how do you get it to put the random value into the room and then do another  okay okie dokie do you just do oh keep it you just declare and initialize random in that crosstalk  down there crosstalk  did it still not work it kind of worked it worked crosstalk  shit ridiculous wait but sevens not even on this thing it didnt even print out a seven though its not printing oh zero one two three thatd be four still though if you did zero one two three thats still four and my index is five it goes from zero to four oh the first one on this in the loop oh damn because it starts the index with one no ls crosstalk  okay but its not an index five so its getting the index wrong because its saving the index every time it runs and checks it so at the end of the loop its going to be the end of the  but how do we get it to store the index value where the max is found we should do it in the if statement wouldnt we because once its gone through the if statement its already met the condition that its at max right yeah because this here is saying that index whatevers here is going to return the right one if this index value was five it wouldnt return thats done in the four loop checking them but once it meets that condition it goes to the if where max is saved as that value at that index right somehow if we extracted the index in that if crosstalk  it would be right right im guessing it has to be thats the only thing i can think of max index im thinking here one oh top did it not work youd have to have crosstalk  in the loop its still wrong i think yeah it keeps eight thats definitely wrong look i had some kind of intelligence to offer look at that okay theres index two that is true thats a double l double l man that took too long thing now calculate the average … calculate the average of all crosstalk  charlie could be a girl ive met a couple of charlies that were girls i have i have fucking crosstalk  how do you do that youd have to take the value of the array index wed have to do that in the loop wouldnt we its definitely going to be a loop it would have to start at index zero right crosstalk  that would be the size given by what why its so annoying it happens so often too i dont know what happened but i think whatever holds it in place  when you go just a little bit too far that shit just falls crosstalk  that a zero right should you declare it outside of the loop though or are you going to have it print in the loop average i got you integers crosstalk  sum why did i put an o as a zero what the fuck its crosstalk  outside you just going to print the print line you really like saving time efficiency is your thing thats funny i have a feeling that its  okay i think it worked for me it worked for me what was it saying crosstalk  brackets i think were about to be on crosstalk  i dont drink that much i used to thats it c im pretty sure it worked for me oh you got d find the elements that have higher values than average value copy them into a new array named high values what the fuck crosstalk  the first array we made was supposed to be called source it says it in the thing i didnt realize it says create an array of integers with userdefined size and name it source then down here it says i didnt understand that then it says in part d for this you need to create a new array with the same type and size of the source array and name it high value mine worked got it now we have to do that shit i feel like part e wont be too hard bro im just saying im giving you a little bit of light im trying to look make sure theres still some sort of light once we get through d were halfway crosstalk  approach d if only weve got to do d still so lets do that ive had to do that i started doing that for my brackets because i dont know  thatd be hilarious how many loops did you use for the part d just one d the high value shit three loops just to do that sounds about right that saves the values or something new array they want us to print the new array but it says it has to have the same type and size thats what im saying it says you have to create a new array with the same type and size of source array and name it high value oh they dont have to be oh well it seems kind of stupid to make an array with a size larger than you know youll need thats true but you can use garages for other shit arrays you can only use to store shit yeah but you can make it into a room or all kinds of things people do that all the time you cant repurpose an array sure i dont know if i want to get that far okay crosstalk  ive had collections call people at work its one of the signs i do need to start going back to the gym why not its all right its not the worst gym ive seen we have right here crosstalk  its behind it yeah thats sweet thats not bad yeah thats why i stayed over here theyre a thousand for residents because the one i got for commuter was  for a year its the same price it was when i lived on campus the fuck yeah because i havent had a parking pass for the last three years because i lived across the street but now i live in south park so i have to have a parking pass unca damn how long did you go there how was it there i knew a lot of people that swam on the swim team there yeah i dont think id like it there are a lot of gay people i call it the pride community i have a problem with the pride community tell me about it try being a really mellow queer and then being with that constantly its  how i looked earlier in class thats how i am about every time im at pride at unca crosstalk  it was like what  people there we have  undergraduates when they had that keith scott lamont thing they had a sit in and a union and all that but they didnt do anything this weekend there was another guy killed at burger king on bettys ward they didnt do anything about that one thats crazy right were trying to learn were trying to learn i thought the thing about the chapel hill  what was it the statue they took down silent sam or something i dont know i think things are going a little too far i get how the symbolism could be used offensive learning that has been the biggest thing that has revolutionized the way i just think especially politically right youre reddish stop going to that social justice place thats why you inaudible  i sit there and im just like do yall not hear what youre saying they pissed me off so much on tuesday at work i went from being available five it pissed me off so much on tuesday at work i went from being available five days to two and a half yeah there is history they have yeah well did you hear about  there was some campus up north i dont remember where it was but theyre literally giving reparations to students who are black because the school owned some hundred slaves or some shit and then they sold them and theyre like revelations of the crosstalk  i think its supposed to be people of descendants of crosstalk  i guess it kind of makes sense but it was being paid for by the students yeah right crosstalk  thats where i took problem with it cause i was like youre charging a tuition or a yearly fee right what did i do and its because they sold their slaves that theyre all  im like what where did that money go i dont know its just confusing and weird and people are handing out people are handing out thats true if we have one times not real laughing hes not in our lab is he i didnt think so i dont friggin know he said he used three i dont think we need three well cause you said he had one counting them to count the index youre at and then one that stored those values if they were higher into the new array and then he used another loop to print the new array but i wouldnt use them i would just print it in the one where youre storing the new array so basically i dont either so i think you have to have one counting the index and comparing the value at that index to the value of the average and then maybe use an if statement to put it into the array cause if it is greater than this then save it to that so you would have to do  pretty much but would you do  you would still do  yeah you would start at zero and you would still do the length of the array because you wanna get all of em array one man cookout got those little cheeseball things now you know like what culvers has the little fried cheese curds cookout has those shits now its over i dont need it either i really dont need it but i eat that shit yeah im not gonna lie i really only get it  i got it today cause they pissed me off in that thing well they just pissed me off cause we had a little white and black people group things about race and i was just like i dont know that shit aggravates me like yall really wanna talk about race but then you separate us by race to talk about race the fuck whatever i plus plus i  is  greater  than  you have to somehow  its called high values underscore high values do you just declare it and not initialize it you have to initialize it cause you have to  you cant do that right cause youre still doing the same size so then we store it into high values but how do we make it  yeah and then we do  shit itll be high values right i  okay now every index thats higher than itll save it at that index will be equal to nine and the same thing for two two he really used three loops for this no wonder he used loops whys he always using loops whats his name by the way i just know him as he goes by the scalawag chase the nicotine guy i dont know his name i know toby all i know is he likes nicotine and i feel like were too far into the semester to laughing im not trying to be like that i could always go look on the team member things i would never have guessed that for his name actually i might crosstalk  oh thats the guy that you buy the vape stuff from so his names isaiah i wouldve picked something else like daniel he looks like a daniel laughing do you have a reason why oh but wouldnt you do it after high values after the crosstalk  loop i dont know if it makes a difference itll print it oh okay chic well it will turn zero and the other values that are not  he used three its nested one nested we used one nested loop so there we go there we go crosstalk  right inaudible  eventually with separating them i just fuckin had this crosstalk  thats true through all this shit what yeah he did so  wed have to do a replace could we use a replace method ooh random shuffle yeah im trying to so basically youre making a new list and  zero and  oh yeah it decreases and then  thats  okay i see that yeah so is temp an actual label or just  oh okay you cant just put it nowhere right and then its i is greater than zero right the random control variable letters dont work for me oh cause you have to typecast the double you can do that  it is false oh so theres like a full quiz yawning none and then none  but after the method called b a crosstalk  what about all the differences between variables objects and how theyre similar crosstalk  i dont know i mean thats what happened in an assignment we did last week cause we had a return  we had to split it and put the first half and the last half  but it wasnt the initial one it was the saved one so that makes sense crosstalk  charging time you feel like youre in a bowl of spaghetti yeah everything like just a tad or an a by that crosstalk  that works word true crosstalk  i guess so reeses pieces no crosstalk  let me get one of the watermelon ones watermelon theres a watermelon one the green apple if you ever do the cause there used to be like jolly rancher jello then i would mix it with the smirnoff green apple that shit didnt even taste like alcohol it was so dangerous i think you may have i dont like it it hurts my face i have not dont did you see the green fairy oh the green is stolen absinthe absinthe you never drink to have fun or you dont drink i like some im a big fan of ciders i love ciders i had two  ounce ciders last night and i have crosstalk  oh that the only one i dont have is question one reference and same well shit what kind of plants do you extract it from like tinctures so like for the cbd of it crosstalk  duh shes just that board yeah even if you put turpines in it you think crosstalk  yeah what kind do you use for that whats the one  theres one that my crosstalk  inaudible  i cant remember the name of this one cause my therapist shes fuck what are all  i forgot what any of this shit is called what is that shit called im trying to think what this thing is my therapist does crosstalk  probably not crosstalk  shit what is this shit called im trying to think yeah crosstalk  its very strong true about what what is the question crosstalk  what is what buddhism bootyism um on buddhism i dont know they focus a lot around suffering ive watched documentaries that material things and like envy and jealousy like all those things  and human existence is suffering so like theyre basically trying to live like  isnt buddhism the one with the middle path shit so theyre trying to live the middle path to like  you know minimize suffering i guess i dont know whats buddhism on the application inaudible  you just put max yeah thats a weird one i was wondering cause max isnt my legal name so they might not crosstalk  theyll know who i am yeah they should know who that is  youre talking about jerry will know crosstalk  geralds the gm over there yeah gerald will know who max is he was so mad when he lost me but he did it to him self so fuck it i dont know if its changed the last time i talked to jamie which was the only manager i liked over there she told me it was getting better but i know she just left cause she got a promotion but the gm cause i was working at the white hall one so some guy named dan his wife is training to come to uncc for managing i dont know anything about her but i heard shes nice i guess i mean gerald not mean hes just lazy i guess its alright depending on what position youre doing whatd you apply for dude  i didnt even read this assignment is there only one thing so its a name search crosstalk  bootyism thats actually hinduism crosstalk  nirvana nirvana yoga pretty sure yoga started with hindus i said im pretty sure yoga started with the hindus yeah no i said yoga yoga is from hindu came from where well yogas a type of martial arts technically i didnt wait we have our recorders on unless you want us to stay and be captive do you wanna stay and be captive richard i feel like a weirdo right search whoa crosstalk  yeah im pretty sure oh no its a lot of work crosstalk  this page with a cat and a coffee says a sequential search but i dont know i have no idea or just search searching searching is what were going with linear what would we return to our inaudible  i think we just went with searching really well its going to be searching search is the process searching true oh its one okay lets say it would be the negative one right did yall get six for six three oh true oh thats supposed to be a selection sort thats what she was talking about earlier whats on the board i saw that and i just scrolled back up just to look at it i didnt want to why did you get the answer above what the fuck oh hey group think eight i thought eight was one for trick question eight where are we going i just have cartridges well i have a little piece but i dont have anything to put it in ill teach you what if you want to have options you know versatility is the name of the game keeping that tolerance yeah thats crazy because theres a poll someone did and it was like  of smokers dont know how to roll i was like no crosstalk  got to start rolling everything like what the fuck i didnt even think about that my friend joseph the same one thats still waiting on his shit i taught him how to roll for his th birthday so i wouldnt have to roll anymore technically it was a birthday present to me but now he has a skill i was like you have a skill im giving you wisdom for your birthday how to roll a blunt i sat i taught him he got it on the first try though taught him the whole thing easier for me and we didnt waste nothing it was great continuing the tradition what my plugs taught me yep im going to teach my children no im kidding true oh yeah thats what my boyfriend said that was me like theyre very discriminatory on that yeah kill you on sight i dont know about that i think so i think its so it starts with the mid being four thats basically like filling out a table okay so what she was doing earlier on the board where she was going through it saying so were pretty much doing that but im pretty sure mid starts with four and its crosstalk  ah shit i just there were no names just our inmate numbers  yeah im  jim bob billy bob oh my god whats the right answer is the question i dont care if its technically right i just want to get the grade i was on rate my professor trying to pick professors for next semester theres like two people with decent reviews in the computer science department the fuck oh obviously i dont know anything time i started but i registered for two classes and i dont know what else to fucking register for i should do them over the summer that way i could open up for fall i dont want to do that shit crosstalk  where did you even get that i have never seen a package like that this is like that whered you get that oh why dont they sell those in stores because i dont want to buy the king size i dont want just two so then i always just end up buying the king size anyways i dont fucking get what theyre talking about oh so we have to were putting it through this method this is fucking stupid honda civic what yeah ive seen those thats where thats from oh my god burritos try again tomorrow i think we could do it i think we just five four crosstalk  whats  its just we have to fill out a table we havent done it i just dont want to keep going up to this thing im good thank you though i appreciate it its got my blue ball over here blue ball i think so its a great number you can get some coolass tattoos on friday the th too yeah oh true true i didnt watch it a lot ive seen like here and there what i saw was always great i know if i started watching it i would get fucking right thats why i wont even any netflix right now because i cant crosstalk  bubble sort who came up with that name why is it called bubble sort oh so its just group search sounds better crosstalk  oh shit there we go i think we said binary yeah you can do this test three times at least tell you its wrong well at least tell you what you got wrong no thats what are we learning anyway what does it say crosstalk  im pretty sure it takes the smallest ones which is doesnt it crosstalk  the first well what if the first is the smallest then its finite all right crosstalk  in multiple phases we pass successfully crosstalk  man i totally totally forgot well i guess shes getting what she wants then thats the kind of material she needs though whoa that would be the best way to get material though with college students crosstalk  oh my god thats actually a brilliant idea fake data crosstalk  bubblesaur true oh my god true i was definitely questioned still questioned im  crosstalk  well it would be so confusing yeah probably crosstalk  i guess its thats selection sort crosstalk  thats what she was talking about selection sort so now we just have the tables things to fill out crosstalk  i just dont want to keep going up and looking at that stupid thing you said yeah well you said binary and then linear they told me the other way around since this was crosstalk  negative one what youd put for number seven binary crosstalk  okay so it starts mystery method all the way up here crosstalk  oh hi crosstalk  inaudible  crosstalk  oh shit is it right yeah thats what we put it was negative one right true so then nine is what crosstalk  four was one yeah yeah bulbasaurus what does that bulbasaur what is i didnt really get into pokemon shouldve everyone was into yu gi oh at my school though yu gi oh was so good it was so big crosstalk  these are all the same are those rows or columns rows what the fuck was three i heard         they do oh theyre all three theyre all thin     did anyone attempt  because i started  and then i got mad crosstalk  hive is two six crosstalk  true oh we have to actually put the spaces in there and shit you should have withdrawn when you still could have oh crosstalk  right crosstalk  trash crosstalk  damn crosstalk  i dont even remember what he looks like i havent seen him in a while well six wasnt in it so inaudible  value i so crosstalk  record the current order of the sorted array of crosstalk  current big curve the index in j crosstalk  so were just showing the iterations theyll be in until theyre fully sorted five three crosstalk  its proven oh no hes up front crosstalk  right normally he just vapes in here anyways crosstalk  so five should be inaudible  crosstalk  just a little bit well so we got        inaudible   i was going to ask because she just said that its supposed to be filled with user input numbers so  but here it says to fill it with random integer numbers  okay  but is the  because it says the dimensions are random and to fill it with random so do that  and still use the random number to generate whats being inputted into the area  okay  for the filling its one and nine  okay thank you  i dont even know what she said  data type all right  this ones only like one activity but theres a few parts to it  oh you started it  yeah yeah howd you start it though because it wasnt open what  im confused  was it for like a second damn  i dont care about that class that much i worked my ass off too this week  time  yeah what the place  heck yeah  to make it start the random number at a certain one thats when we have to do the plus right  the times and then the plus  plus one  yeah its like a coordinate point on like an xy plane  calculate the average  no we cant were doing  and  what you talking about  i know  im trying to decide if im going to take summer classes or not  oh yeah ive honestly been considering transferring  what do they mean by maximum average  its in the book  its fun just keep clicking it and it looks like a bunch of different weird ass shapes  you said next does it have another index  so you get an infinite array  why would we want that  what would we use it for what could it be used for  thats the most practical use for it right there thats all we need it for  ive been listening to a lot of rock recently  youve got to you either have to have the rock or the edm on for lifting  true true  i definitely use that song for some workouts  bullshit  its generated randomly  its for both its for both  oh i did it wrong shit i just did the random integer wrong thats an easy fix because for the dimensions its two to nine  it worked look how small that one is  thats the smallest inaudible  ive seen it make its four i love it go random all right  they might get here by the end of class  oh shit  so its for each column  okay that makes sense i found the average of the entire array  it doesnt say  no no no the average of the you ordered food  oh no because you can literally get like eleven or walmart and whatever you can get all that shit delivered  right then thats a problem  is it the same driver  they havent gotten a driver yet  oh shit  yeah with the nested four loop  you said what im sorry  oh because you were waiting on it  yeah thats some bullshit theres more than three columns oh no theres not theres four i was thinking rows  i was like column and row got flipped in my heard  no thats just the sum but then all you have to do is divide the sums  but that has to be in there  i dont know  yeah  okay i think this is right for the average but now how to compare the averages because this is just yeah  but do they want us to save each column into an individual one  yeah  wait the total sum of the averages or the whole array  this is what i have for the average of each column but i have it just with a running total for each column  youre getting your chicken wings oh is it oh shit  its the same thing  yeah you want to print it outside of the loop  yeah  separately yeah  yeah the averages are right this is the first run  its a little smaller its just big numbers though give me smaller numbers okay we can work with this  nine      oh that is wrong  that is definitely wrong i guess because the total is double  that shits straight from the book too  maybe michaels more trustworthy  who knows  well lets see if so lets see nine plus six  eight plus okay so this is how you can get the sum  i dont understand how its not printing this out every time  it doesnt make sense  okay okay  whoa oh shit  did you hear that i didnt realize it was that loud  oh yeah a lot of postmates people just have like people in their car because i used to do that  and i figured out what was wrong with the average i was dividing by the number i got the rows and columns mixed up again so now what im trying to do is fill in the array in the loop and then print the array out after the loop  i kind of forgot how do you fill in an array in a loop  okay my brain is like  im thinking very hard  five million times  no im retyping this line damn it there we go  check this one easily  seven point five  yeah  because this is not a normal class  the umbrella  so how did he do it  so it looks like he didnt  instead of saving the running total to a temporary variable he just put it into the array  thats a smart idea so he just made an array of the sums  what do you mean  where is it saying its out of bounds though  so average  we do  sara is  from my understanding its just comparing them and finding the max one  which average is the highest  yeah see it says the maximum average value is on the example  i think i got mine to work for the average shit fuck oh my god  i just gave up trying to print mine like that  we do  twelve crosstalk  were we supposed to say our numbers oh im  sorry im over here trying to clear a fucking space crosstalk  yeet mine probably is inaudible  its so versatile crosstalk   any fucking situation fucking inaudible  words theres emphasis im free all the time every day  you know what would be more fun inaudible  latinos inaudible  drinking out of it if anything ill just bring in crosstalk  and just play that in the back well i mean ive got to crosstalk   yes actually yes inaudible   im off on friday  you always work on friday  yeah friday mornings thats why i said you work on friday it took three weeks that we crosstalk    were going to try to get jeff to come but well see  he seems like a christian man but  in the alcohol inaudible  how crosstalk  take a picture of what oh that crosstalk  okay crosstalk    no were just doing this  yeah yeah thats it thats all you need that is a hard working cell just  crosstalk  powerhouse crosstalk    thats how the other cells died they crosstalk    youve got a major lemon why crosstalk  no lazy like the rest of us  ive seen the peaches  damn those are janky  i appreciate your generosity crosstalk  send me the address im walking crosstalk  i did this without realizing it crosstalk   why not just make five arrays  and then   i could just make five arrays it just shows press enter  its almost like crosstalk  all the way down what do you mean it puts the one array into place and says press enter yes show me what i did wrong because chris wont  what because theyre smarter than us thats why i said us  smart than me and us  yeah but now i have to do it to the point where it checks to see if it lines up correctly either you win or you dont win  crosstalk    so i messed up the first time and hit enter crosstalk    crosstalk  good fucking crosstalk    bang bang bang  i feel positive about our new inaudible  simulator no one does speaker  tough it out  should i be putting the code into discord now we did have six arrays without meaning to i was just trying to get one to work  crosstalk  has to listen to all this stuff  number  was vulgar creative but vulgar creative and vulgar and a complete dumb ass because hes miced up and he forgets his miced up  miced up and he goes crosstalk    crosstalk    crosstalk  changing colors crosstalk  its so right for me its just colors everywhere  crosstalk  colors  its so dull i cant crosstalk  it thank you no there is a better way because i had it to the point where it was showing me a bunch of different color formats you could change inaudible  and then crosstalk    because i had to erase all of this because of crosstalk   crosstalk  painful having to go back through the video to make sure i did it right it was awful  you son of a column  watch your fucking mouth  this was two weeks ago the lab part four oh dude i save them all i just crosstalk   ,anonymous  youre  number  damn  feel  like  got  closer  thing  gon  na  fall  feel  like  gon  na  fall  hold

i apologize in advanced because i cuss a lot testing one two can we put this on us yeah fuck how do you put this on how do you  oh no no i got it there we go probably just too close though oh youre letting everybody know probably part of your experiment hmm what the fuck is going on you dont have it what is count vera vows you dont have that initial what are you talking about it needs to be initialized cause it doesnt understand it yeah dave is telling me when you got it because this gon be a long day no i wish sarah was here see i cant do anything cause they want the method to be a string how do they expect to return an integer was i right about what about what then what did you do wrong why didnt you include it in your main method before oh okay okay oh everything works for you then got something going on over there over chad i dont think it is how did you make public static the way it happened like you didnt give it a title how did it  like when you did public static void on the other assignments you you just print it out right then and there and the if statements were in there or if statements werent in there oh this just the system now but then but you still didnt return anything in the public static void okay okay okay so you just  for me to do this for a void i have to include everything in the void like ask them the word im gonna try that im gonna try that but like you still have your main right okay so i just start from the beginning wait it has to be  and you included your variables in the title right that youd use so how so how did you do that since i dont know how many i would use string vowels so why is it asking for a return type yeah  but im not trying to return anything oh wait i know what it is i know what it is what she say i dont know why yours is working oh did you just delete theres nothing wrong with your class i mean your yeah theres nothing wrong with your class thats the only thing thats wrong with mine this cause it wants me to return it but theres nothing to return it to i commented out of everything unless thats the problem cause i saw you take it out so were doing this all wrong we cant use void we cant use void can you use void cause the main method has to be called has to have the string in there the main method has to be the string oh we dont get in trouble for it then because  okay they was us a numerical value right i cannot return an integer thats under a string method i dont know how to do that i dont know how to transfer i dont understand do you see what im saying cause like the word you put in is the string and im doing the math in the main method no it wont let me return it yeah thats the only issue the split need no pseudo code im still trying to figure out first oh thats easy its so fucking easy its so fucking ea thats literally what crosstalk  cause this is look look you see that shit you see those quotation marks yeah like the if crosstalk  so like you find index and then you get the letter i think and then you just place the variable that you have diverted to for that letter and then huh okay ugh dude im not even doing a while loop statement for that im on some different shit but if it works ill tell you gimme  can you do me a favor yeah actually you know what i dont know what the issue is its not even asking me did she just say no string crosstalk  okay i got you for the second one though davis i cant i cant i cant i cant i cant nothing is wrong it does not ask me for a word you know what ill just do the second one ill just do the second one lord have mercy she said not to use split and instructure and sub string okay oh wait we gotta use a method for that how do write a method that accepts both string and integers it says write a method that accepts a string and an integer but what about the title of the  cause thats how i did it for the last one you do string a variable and then you do the title of the method and then i understand the logic for it but it wants us to make a method that inputs string and integers  huh its what you can what o c yep cool its not cool cause we cant get this done if i dont know how to do that this is what happens when sarah isnt here what but still but still i dont understand i dont understand whats going on well no cause we were sane enough to pick a lab thats at a decent time not in eight o clock in the morning the first lab but like the first lab its at eight thats what im saying s still too early for me if i had a choice if this lab i would choose five o clock for a lab id never choose anything before five o clock im serious no who are you texting crosstalk  oh you are texting  hmm its the plug its the plug oh did you literally just say inaudible  i need to go flip turn for the last activity i know but still damn yeah but still damn they wont even look at the program if you dont submit the flow chart i hope youre hearing this its like either a zero or you dont  wow im gonna try something fuck ooh does that loop it but does it loop it see i have to have  that doesnt loop it because if you do see i wont use a loop if i dont need to like if i can use contains the api and separate each character that i want to do and they see it as that like okay like in assignment two did you do loop for h and g i mean g and i well did you loop yeah did you loop g and f actually yeah yeah but im talking about the functions for g and f no its next thursday our lab test yes yes thats good we all have a test on friday let me see see i dont understand why you had to do that you being so complicated you being so complicated no you do not is this for f see all i did was just   i did total length of the sentence subtracted by the length of the cutoff from spaces using a loop which is unnecessary im not hard on you its just  the goal is not to do as much work as you need to okay but do you understand the second part youre welcome to you can just use replace she said we cant use split structure or something else i didnt hear her say it or we can ask david or chris what can we not use yeah turn it off hey chris what do you not use for the second part we can use inaudible  yeah   crosstalk   this is not inaudible  today look i can probably do abc thats it after that its gonna take me a while so no lets not think about that right now lets just do a so we already asked them something so i think  crosstalk  so thats what i did to do an array of single letters put a space yeah it  no capital yeah okay so what i think since we dont know the range of it until the user inputs it i think we could just do array equals math dot random zero to nine you know what i mean okay so if i put in  theres gonna be  lists of numbers name but since we  since the size of the array can change yeah but what im saying is that the user input can be different each time so we have to do it for all the sizes of it so i think what you can do which is do the variable array let me see so what is it math dot random are you already looking it up math dot random right capital m no i dont oh i gotta do  inaudible  what the numbers in the array you get it thats  no it says prompt user to input a size between  to  so the range is gonna change each time the user inputs something so as them a range and then you use the range for the size of the array yeah yeah its like reading a book i forgot how to do math random oh here we go this is zero to nine zero to nine looking at  so youre gonna do math dot random how many times exactly in the same to randomize all the numbers in the array so im assuming the way im doing it works because it takes in the input range and then the variable for the array the list of the array so thats what i did so i hope thats just same look im crosstalk  ah what mmhmm affirmative okay and thats do tomorrow okay thank you because you gotta  okay so crosstalk  i made an array for the list of the range of the user inputted right so if its  its gonna be fifty to sixty whatever and then since we dont want to do that what you just showed me because we dont know how much and it changes each time and it tells us to randomize each list of numbers in the array i think that if you put in the inputted number in the array list it randomizes all the numbers in the list okay so do you understand b a little yeah so the max is gonna be a  number i mean if its a big big range it should be a  in there if you know what i mean whatcha laughing about i know yeah im going to high school tomorrow do you know if they want to display i dont know what that is i think that was a shuffling thing so i cant use index of i cant use index of what are you doing well why do you think it wouldnt work thats why im looping it but youre trying to find so you do dot link like what she said okay crosstalk  wheres max no were not wait oh like youre trying to find the so if index of two has  and index of  has  it would take  cause its the lowest index with the highest number to it but let me see how that works se we do the length of it i think it should still work it doesnt matter no go back oh you have it why zero why zero so were making something new but are you using but how does the force statement know that so explain it again array a which is what the user input for the list right okay and then you made a force statement for it but array length is what but array length  length is what zero or the user input but the user input number or the array are you sure cause that zero is hooking me up  thats what im saying i was like are you sure youre going to put in the user input and if a is less i mean if i is less than  were gonna have to ask sarah if we did crosstalk  yeah thats the part that scared me cause im not sure if was gonna do the whole list fuck i think this is what he meant oh shit i broke it oh no i didnt sarah do we need her so it said if  so for array i is greater than the max why are the parenthesis like that it kills me what oh yeah why is it like that were kinda guessing over here i failed my chemistry test yes oh no i accepted that im mad at the chemistry exam because it was badly worded he put our last question was something he did not teach crosstalk  and yeah yeah he was talking about theoretical yield or something crosstalk  put something down fill up the while page its just math its just mad you know some of it was multiple choicecrosstalk  i did not know the last onecrosstalk  which is the one that he did not teach us crosstalk  i put in something random because its a range and i should know inaudible  yeah thats better than nothing crosstalk  yeah i know i still have to put in something random yeah cause you got one part of it right or something okay so like for each time it does it for math basically wait so array size or the input crosstalk  in math random yeah did you ask her about under the max okay okay so what was it whats wrong with it what did you put in can you go back to the  is that the wait okay  okay not yet i think we can still go are you calling it a day thats a sign is it okay i didnt break it so like for number c thats in yeah that too do we just add up whats in the list and then divide it by yeah so like divide it by how much the list consists of like if the user can you come here i cant see it thats c  thats thats b thats b dang yeah well yeah i think so i always forget to do that okay so you did that part right double max same thing yeah so i think what goes in the bracket is the highest number like your variable for how is that messed up no go over it crosstalk  go over it just over yeah what it say are your brackets in line thanks mmhmm affirmative so i think i figured out i think thats supposed to be  cause its the highest one if that makes any sense to you yeah it runs it terminated so now i have to find the index i dont know how to do that no  why davis why so now we have to fond the index of that index of max thats it it set it go back go back crosstalk  yes is that a new method or something i dont understand what that is mmhmm affirmative wait its the same step which is extra one step so how come it isnt an index of x oh i have to do that first  why dont you just socialize dow whatever you teenager do nowadays i know you got kids how are you older than me  one month oh okay i never took you as a march person i never took you as a yeah october september oh you lied it is september you dont have to do the first thing again i dont think so i dont think so just watching the new kim possible movie what its like a virgin oh shit okay you want me to be the teacher now my voice is better than everybody here yeah i always project i can be loud how does it work why are you always struggling it doesnt work oh outside the for statement what happenedwhat happened i think its because we only have a month left sort of crosstalk  what was the range you put in  it just keeps printing out  so you kinda lied to me so okay okay sure its not friday yet man oh are you going home you gonna have a dinner you gonna go out to eat you family dont care about you like that can you drive have you ever gotten a ticket i feel like youre lying to me i feel like youre gonna get into an accident a collision i dont know you be like you be doing something on your phone and  i could see you doing that no i did no wish upon you im just saying if you saw a snake right now youd flip what if you were in the car but what if you were in the car i feel like youd be like but im saying the snake is outside the car and youre driving are you sure but you wont freak out did you hit it oh no stop why are you looking up spider videos oh no australia is crazy bro the spider come into my car thats when i would really freak out snakes dont freak me out but spiders so calculate the average of the array elements i understandcrosstalk  were not going to display all of the array at once we dont need to know what they are we just need to add it up i dont know cause i dont want to be array plus array plus array plus array ah does it say anything about taking the average of the array lemme see it let me see something here i wonder if theyre gonna really listen to this for an hour and thirty minutes yeah im pretty sure they have to aint nobody finished with this really theres always something going on with you but yours dont work my computers better than yours yeah its touchscreen slow ass motherfucker im leaving do my exit uh davis davis he no he know he heard me youre already standing up they can hear me right they cant its good right there i hope they hear us oh that performs a binary search question  damn it its  mmhmm affirmative okay its different than  thats what i think it is a bunch i think thats what we have to do i think linear okay but binary you do i dont know youre the one that knows more than me okay then its negative  what the fuck dude have you seen question  what the fuck is uhuh negative wait oh thats what were using okay i didnt even know we were using that i was just so confused what okay its mid minus  oh wait yeah so high is the length minus one are we allowed to put this in eclipse why how they dont have shit to do so whatre they saying crosstalk  just keep going down a little more its like every day conversations like hey did you feed your cat today i get the freaking notifications crosstalk  yeah im still waiting for the one useful crosstalk  inaudible  i think it was tuesday she was like im going to take a nap in the classroom up above or something and if anyone wants to join a couple of years nothing yeah is int k equals  is that going to be  or  suppose int k equals  is that going to be  or  because its not a double no its just hypothetical does it round up or down no okay you have an int but you cant have  stored as an int right because its a decimal does it display  no it displays something no no no okay if you literally just have int k equals  or  and then you have systemout k it goes to  is that  the second one but this isnt inaudible  this is the binary one for crosstalk  inaudible  oh because a maybe crosstalk  key of   its  i think its binary because yeah im trying to find this fucking book i dont care i need the book youre a fag  okay so basically there was an online pdf of the book and just today it went offline and now its gone and so now im trying to find another one i have a paper copy at home but because its at home and its a big binder okay i asked you that and you told me no crosstalk  we just broke it what does key equal so its  no its  step  is  right okay wait oh shit yall figured that out i thought they said it was wrong or something oh okay its  wait whats step  quit being a little bitch whats step  whats step  i dont mmmm negative step  literally step  ive got to figure this shit out mmhmm affirmative  whats the length of it minus  okay  yeah okay okay  yeah okay that makes sense now i literally just didnt understand okay thank you yeah the next ones multiple and neighboring thats right  i found it its multiple neighboring i have no idea what sort you know its bubble or selection bubble because this one right above it it says you only need to focus on bubble and selection thats my hunch and if we just did that then awe shit hm no theres more  tonight she said shes not extending this yeah basically dude i dont understand this  im just guessing did you get  wait i think i got it give me a second but i think i got it i just submitted yeah i got a  out of  and it doesnt tell you the right answers so i cant help you it doesnt tell me it tells me if its incorrect okay question  if you put  that is wrong question  if you put  that is wrong  was negative  yeah mmhmm affirmative  yeah just those two and then the last one  yeah negative  negative  it didnt tell me it didnt me what was right it just told me if it was right or not yeah  youre good so you have two numbers one for the column one for the row right and now youre going to put it in the array  whoa whoa whoa  you know i hope youre giving me good grades on the when we do the exit document mmhmm affirmative that survey in order for us to get extra points this is about your partners every time weve done one of these see now i dont believe you you know the survey we have to do every time we do one of these at the end of the class and it says like does your partner blah blah blah blah blah you didnt do yours so did it work out boy dont dont do that dont do that it dont work oh you know why i think it doesnt work cause theres no numbers in there  so we just do a four statement right how do you do a loop to random numbers again oh my god  what is row im so confused what am i looking at yeah but you gotta do it for every single like the rows and the columns are you sure thats it to me that doesnt make any sense cause like youre trying to do c right lets say c is the length of it so dont you do main array c dot length right but youre just but how do you know how to fill it with c or are you going to do that yeah cause i fill random numbers in the row and the column okay so it has the blocks already so if i just do one math random its going to do math random for everything already in it no ten plus two ten plus two one through nine oh yeah then ten plus one mmhmm affirmative cause you need another yeah nevermind dang so you already did the randomization correct so now you got system outed what do you mean to display it no you just do array to string system out well import arrays  arrays capital a dot two string capital s and then i guess main array oh my god i dont know whats wrong look what i did last time how about take away the arrays to string no do main array no hold on erase it erase that plus no get rid of the parentheses yeah so do main array plus quotation marks no space between it  yeah close it close it with the parentheses lets see if it works what how did i fix this problem how did i fix this problem i know i fixed this problem man im serious i did this do main array m  or one of your variables yeah you can do that just put it that or c is it together or does that c stand alone oh boy im going to try it out you know how like i forgot how to display the actual thing and not the no well im davis im davis cause he got it oh  wait wait wait is that a nine out of nine no its not it could be i was wrong you might want to change that to nine and it said two to nine right okay theres no problem with that its just i get it okay so let me understand the four statements man let me understand the four statements i just need to see it so for the second loop you put main array row from the initial for the you put that variable in the four loop in the new four loop print out what you did oh okay so no there we go so you then you would do math random right youd do main array row and column did i say nine right yeah nine plus one so all you did was just system out main array i mean arrays two string main array right okay oh i have to do it for them right so just whatd i do so you guys know where i went this weekend you know where i did like where i went to this weekend i went to western carolina university i mean theres some stuff that i was like oh this is nice i mean there was a lake there was a waterfall there was hiking trails hey thats what im saying but like i came like a warm day a decent day i was like okay this isnt so bad but i was like my friend she lives in scott im like this is shitty like this is prison scott scott hall in western carolina this place is shitty on the outside but when you walk into the buildings youre like yeah like i was like this is a nice place to go but i was like theres too many distractions because the drugs are too easy the alcohol are too easy like  no but still my friend was like you want to go to a party and i was like why yeah i was like why and hes like to do something i was like okay she was like were going to lamb or do you want to go to the duck house i was like whatre you talking about so we went to the lamb it was shitty they played this country song that was made by billy ray cyrus i was like i dont hate it its just like these people are shitty theyre nice theyre nice but the people are shitty i was like i met some cool people but im like this place is shitty i was like i cant go here just the level of trashiness theres a level of trashiness that i cant do really i feel like app is has more class i feel like app i thought app was more closer to civilization app i feel like im angry its because their classes are so easy at western yeah thats what im saying i was like people like my brother were saying i was like oh yeah you know yeah i dont think i dont its shitty  its so shitty its cheap i was like you think you can walk to your classes or you could if you think you could walk to another dorm though you might as well just drive up the hill i was like i aint doing this i was like im glad i didnt come here dont go to western you might just for like a where app i dont know you know you always have that one guy thats like im going to clemson im going to clemson maybe the person i knew was saying he was going to clemson for years in school no yeah only because his family went to clemson oh oh  im glad charlotte existed because if i had to go to western no im just saying i wouldve gone to app did you get into wilmington huh no i said if charlotte didnt exist i wouldve gone to app at least you got waitlisted i got rejected from wilmington like you have to play a sport to get into wilmington thats what i heard it was like all the people i knew who got into wilmington played a sport and their gpas werent that good and their sats no yeah that was a class though yeah but like if charlotte didnt exist i wouldve gone to app or do my best to transfer to nc state now it is it wasnt back then no not ecu have any of yall been to ecu its too crazy cause theres stuff to do it is apparently a lot of people from charlotte go to western throughout the semester yeah there always like theres nothing to do in charlotte i was like no theres stuff to do in charlotte its just that the people here are too stuckup youd have money no its true people here like if you lived in south village youd be kind of stuck up you can ask for him but there is stuff to do here in charlotte you just have to have money everybodys been telling me that should i live off campus like an apartment like not under charlotte but an apartment i dont think i think id be too lazy to cook for myself you know really nah id be too lazy to go on campus id be too lazy nobody thrives on campus you can ask prim you right no its not no you dont cause nothing goes on in the campus even you got a bad attitude with some of the people on campus the guy in our dorm that always talks about baseball whats happening now im on b oh print it out well im on part b davis you told me wrong oh is it let me see yours dont go to western davis im serious you get raped like theres only i still cant get the images out of my head you lie to me oh outside the four line right let me see no it didnt i stopped it whatd you do oh so youre doing c so youre doing columns dont dont tell me it reminds me of how much i have to cram before each at least yall get to sign up for classes yeah well i cant sign up for the classes that i want because i dont have a major or a minor you know what fuck you davis fuck you no freshman theyre like you have to declare a major to do these english classes i was like why yeah as a minor as a minor thats what im saying no i have to i dont have to declare a minor for english to take english classes because its english okay prim i got this i mean davis i got this looky here do another four loop why are you doing the method did it ask for a method i mean do it your own way so what are you doing do you have super glue with you do you have super glue with you its getting worse each day look i got shitted in i dont you right we have  minutes  minutes dont we get out at  oh yeah but do you just do the length of the main method or do you do the length of the column this is what i did i took the main array of the column but my frayed end doesnt have a value but it should have a value after you get all this my brains not working so would it be system out dont you have to do that in there though cause youre going to have to store it im done mmhmm affirmative when on the weekend  on the weekend okay well they got inspected oh yeah they had to wash it yeah and they have to wash their clothes and everything they have to wash everything thats crazy and the other room everybodys out of it yeah you might as well just close the whole room down and burn it so are they still in holshouser or its a dorm what is it a dorm where is maple ive never heard of this maple belk gym i need to check for my fafsa do you think i can change from like living off campus you think i can still change that i mean everybodys telling me oh off campus is way cheaper i mean do you live in the city of charlotte see but im but those are apartments from charlotte those apartments from the other side of university boulevard its not charlotte thats true so thats why everybody was trying to get those apartments wait from the left are we still on university boulevard is it on the left side like you turn the main entrance is as you turn left is it really new its on this side yeah yeah its like past circle k okay ive seen those oh i remember what the maple is i think i remember some guy from my high school it was owned by charlotte but they had a pool and everything and it was basically well he aint no athlete but it was charlotteowned he had a living room a bed a kitchen like it was basically a house on campus im talking about on charlotte of this building where that at of what oh i thought you meant of this building is it like in there or is it sticking out from the so like the one right in front okay i need to check that out its cheaper if you have more roommates right so like would i if i had an apartment for the school year do i still keep it throughout the summer  thats good but i mean i feel like if i drop the lease somebody else will come and take the room can that happen to like stop that room for you for the next year yeah but if you want to come into the exact room and somebody signed it before you thats your fault they cant do anything about it so you have to sign it for each year and would it thats true oh okay cause how much is our board like  board board yeah im not getting any fafsa money im broke as shit for this whole year you do fafsa for one year right or you do two semesters i think what it came out to is    no   i think so how do you get more money than me and im broke as fuck yeah but my moms like this is too much i was like no no no no shit i dont know how it works i can bring my car but that makes sense now to bring my car if i live off campus but youre still on campus oh so you want to get here by car you really want to get hit by a car okay does anybody know of a place that has glue glue i mean glue no i mean on campus im too lazy to go off campus are you sure they have it and expensive too  like their shot glasses are  im just saying are you done davis no im not like you goodbye recording  print it why do you always have a crosstalk  of class projects why you always got packaged class project crosstalk  you you dont know how to organize it no i was confused of whether or not you were just supposed to put in five fourloop statements we only or its just crosstalk  it just runs five times print it print it im not sure if got to use a for statement though it says comeoutout fuck what are you doing another one for no you just need one yeah because you already save all of it in that one variable whatd i say whatd i say crosstalk  myself im creating sound effect yes do eight yeah do five do four well it says out of bounds wait is it line nine is it line nine thats the problem cant you  it doesnt say see i dont understand  you do the random number and she initialized it as num right is zero to nine whatd you do less than five right thats what you did right sometimes it runs then sometimes yeah no fucking clue crosstalk  ima ask her what is yours printing  crosstalk  world creator what  why does yours do that that dont mean nothing keep printing the crosstalk  maybe its the random numbers because it says zero to nine im doing it zero to nine what see youve got to know your number you can do the next part because i dont know were basically doing the same thing except were starting with nine and then were going to do five then were going to do an if statement we gon do this we get this we gon get out of here early lets do this the wild statement is that what you talking about youre not retarded listen if you were retarded youd be one of those people that dont show up to maddies calculus class excuse me wait wait does the user have to do anything oh press enter i dont understand you got the ones the ifs wait wheres everybody just the class are you going to come next are you going to come for the next classes is this your last class i know crosstalk  are you tired no you didnt no you didnt what time did you go to sleep how do you go to sleep at  and wake up at  pm then you went to class in the morning when did you wake up exactly have you ever worked in your life have you worked what was your hours was it in the day time was the sun out then what time did you sleep oh my fucking god no if i was working i had to go sleep around   what is that are you cheating see i dont understand how to do that wild statement if we have to do one i just want to see  im actually stuck i did everything on the board but i dont understand this game functions huh no no i cant major in computer science and minor in secondary education that is too much what yeah yeah then ill minor in english itll be easier to be an english teacher or crosstalk  teacher money what i look like to you poor what are you doing thats what im saying crosstalk  do you know somebody rich do you know somebody rich davis everybody taking it everybody already on the crosstalk  crosstalk  what here i can be the side man what does that have to do with anything yes they are especially in hong kong in thailand yeah  yeah im pretty sure they are oh yeah you told me about it i think you told me about this crosstalk  were you traumatized no he crosstalk  raise your hand davis im tired of asking questions i just hate it when i go back if you ever go and be like are you still want to be a pharmacist thats what i was saying because i didnt know what i wanted to be i thought theres too much schooling to get  i dont no i heard it was actually two years well compared to schooling no they dont im pretty sure it was two years if none of that works out i can always be like  whats it called i know the people on the airplane yes she was going to join the mile high club a fullfledged pharmacist like dr inaudible  pharmacist see no thats too  okay crosstalk  no thats the name i gave you what do you dont believe me what is that thats too much especially since i went to a bad high school yeah yes the best around crosstalk  but its still hes crosstalk  our chances of getting extra credit thats what youre going to get a c youre going to get a a yeah im struggling no bum bum bum  no and this school is stupid they make you do presentations for no reason i dont know what the fuck that is no a inaudible  no biology is supposed to be reading the textbook taking notes and making sure you prepare for the test thats all it is memorization not a presentation not group work i was just saying that because i didnt know what i wanted to be what are you gon be you gon be what a math major mathematician no she wouldnt get she gon be culture shocked what crosstalk  high school whered you go lake norman like the country like taylorsville country no its country see but we dont yeah but we dont give a shit about morrisville or huntersville its really country right its city its a town you tell me yall got smoothie king a chickfila mcdonalds burger king subway jersey mikes no to be in a city relentless no i dont think so google  im pretty sure hes look it up if he knew how to crosstalk  who is that see but if i see this friend im going to be like what you relentless about  still if you go and get a tattoo you gon have to explain why yeah like why you got a eye why crosstalk  did it that way he shouldve done it this way he shouldve done it like right here thats what im saying he shouldve done it like right here or like this is he white looks like an i oh my god do you want to me to do it put your crosstalk  yeah but i dont understand how the key works i dont understand interkey you know what i mean it just says please enter like press enter you know what im saying like i dont understand why it doesnt keep running until you win why does it stop when it says you didnt win even though obviously it doesnt line up did i just hear what i heard did i hear what i just heard in the middle of the night or just now what happened tell me tell me joking yeah what what the hells going on in holhauser  have you noticed that people are still spitting on the fucking elevator they have some nastyass motherfuckers in holhauser i noticed the flood it was like when was it  did we had a fire drill or was it just outside no retarded retarded is this a big guy or is this  like can he hold his liquor still why people in holhauser trifling im surprised he didnt get  well it depends if they call campus police saying  if youre drunk in any level i wonder how much that ticket was   so fucking  i need to see this person  who was this person wait you got in trouble what  who came in oh you were in hunt i thought you were in holhauser yeah i know but you got in trouble in holhauser or you got in trouble at hunt why you open the door i wasnt paying attention thats extra this was in geo what you answered thats so crosstalk  if you get in trouble again they give you a ticket which is  on who blame it on who is he  inspection did you have that college experience why dont you go back to high school the high school experience oh so you were about that life in high school no in high school yeah you judged them crosstalk  yeah you judged them  you want a hat was it over the years i cant see yours dont run its zero to four not zero to five whats this big deal about tiger woods won what of what what youve been paying the only golf tournament that its a big deal because he won oh what injuries how do you get a injury in golf golf seems easy let me play we did all that but whats confusing me,apologize  advanced  cuss  lot  testing  one  two  put  u  yeah  fuck  put  oh  got  go  probably  close  though  oh  youre  letting  everybody  know  probably  part  experiment  hmm

today is march th  i got it sick lit i guess just  i just clipped it onto the little thing here okay fbi man it be like that sometimes that is weird that is a fat weird let me see oh you understand this you understand this  same yes what you want im just gonna try to do all these individually because i think thats what the problem is yeah well im probably doing it a really dumb way but i think its gonna work hmm dont use a return a statement okay here i did that for a few of these okay so when youre doing this when yore doing a public static void everything is gonna be in here so when i went to return choice c all that there is is just choice c in this hm mmhmm affirmative no i just printed everything out in this so that it runs this yeah i kind of consider public static void like when its going down here its going through like a black hole and once you get to the end of it it just stops and thats where yeah hm mmhmm affirmative the ones youre carrying over i just did one and it was string sentenced i dont know how it works if you have multiple public static void is let me just finish it set method return no mines not working it kept on saying its one when its not one whats wrong with yours when you use void you dont have string in there i think thats the problem hmm why not its all the string its still can set a string then you can do it with no void and just return it i dont know either yeah it wouldnt even let you output that right yeah i dont know i dont know it is uh huh so if you just put like a slash in there  yeah that one shouldnt be hard i dont think that ones gonna be hard except i dont understand you havent figured out this one yet right and sub string for the second one how do you write what in the little parentheses at the end of it in here youll do string and then taking the string and then yeah and the idea youre listening to her right now nunya business huh nah its just some girl fuck you yeah sirrus never cared about what charts crosstalk  its on google it does im just doing it sort of right but i mean i think that could work too i think that could work too but did i do loop yeah here look what i did i made looping a inaudible  and it was true and then when they put in j it makes looping false so while looping is true it does all of these and as soon as they input j it makes looping false yeah this is what i did for g and f well you got to you gotta use sentence length to keep the you dont yeah thats f wheres f i just counted how many spaces there were okay you probably couldve done it for less thats just how i saw it mmhmm affirmative she said we cant use replace right okay can we use okay crosstalk  we gotta take this thing off really turn this off or do you turn it on okay are you following this inaudible a good question we crosstalk   oh no hell no hell to the no yeah shuffling them i just okay yeah the size a space right there duh i dont understand what it means fill the array with crosstalk  mmhmm affirmative okay we dont know what those numbers are yet so doing a is what fills it with the numbers we just yeah yeah thats what though you gotta import it too dont  do you no  i always forget that too after  hm mmhmm affirmative so you can set it to where my list is it has  spots and so my list at  is  so im wondering if you can do my list for all of them equals math dot random well if i just  well you could do it that way but we dont know how many the users gonna input it so thats i do that all the time well id dont do it on this computer but i do it on the when we did the labs on there so okay well dont worry about case studies okay so crosstalk  i just dont understand how use num a right there but its also the user input i dont mmhmm affirmative okay okay yeah we gotta find the max mmhmm affirmative there can be multiple of those right so we cant just do yes i do except the rinse bit about your hair for years um i have no idea cause it doesnt show what the outputs supposed to look like unless thats the output yeah i have no idea what that crosstalk  hm from what for  yep well i dont understand how index of what what of that wouldnt work would work or wouldnt work im sure it doesnt because i just dont understand how i feel like it shouldve worked but i just dont feel like its going to you know with this because its gotta  theres so may possible things can you set it as an index of  because theres gonna be so many  there could be all s so i dont understand basically i just looked in the book and it says finding the largest element and it showed that the one crosstalk  yeah oh wait finding the smallest index what is the smallest index of the largest what does that mean oh and this does random shuffle oh okay except theyve got my list as equal to zero you just get rid yeah oh that says double max okay yeah hm well cause its setting max at zero its setting max at arrays at zero cause its gonna go all the way up and go the highest until it stops and gets to the array dot length once it gets to the end its gonna stop okay so its got a double max thats set at array a mmhmm affirmative yeah and so n i is  and well i is less than array as length and then increment i and so its uh its gonna be its gonna well if youve got it set at array length its gonna go through all of the numbers till it gets to the end all the random numbers all the random numbers i think so do we need that zero yeah i just wanna run this overnight do you know why thats happening it says index  is out of bounds it says at  do you hear him he said put math dot random in its own set of parenthesis oh i dont know why i  ahhh okay that makes sense its still the same error and then its just max equals uh  array name and then i those brackets oh are you talking about those or those are brackets er yeah those are called brackets you use them for arrays youve never used those in math before um okay so im getting this error and i think somethings wrong with this line mmhmm affirmative to  okay yeah okay yeah okay oh okay okay are we displaying all of the do we display a and then display b or do we just i dont  okay yep thank you so did you hear what she did mmhmm affirmative instead of having it as crosstalk  instead of having it as the input you make the loop and have it go up by one every time so it checks everything yeah i just asked about inaudible  okay well now now this one doesnt work same thing as the other one its out of bounds i think i can fix this though size  inaudible  im gonna go to the bathroom real quick ill be right back  so i just did zero i shocked you sorry oh shit does it run lets fucking do it then okay wait i got that the highest one was  alright were gooch wait here let me try one more thing oh wait yeah okay then it inputted an  so theres no  goochie yeah copy oh well we just  wait im trying to  do we even have to get the index yeah im gonna do it sorry index of max okay okay okay so its basically the same  statement as that one so right there right here is the only difference and so it puts max at my list and this one youve got index of max equals zero and so its index of max equals to i yeah basically you gotta make an index of x equals zero and index of max sorry equal to zero wait your birthdays tomorrow happy early birthday dude crosstalk  you dont im an idiot no you dont you dont oh my god i cant believe they actually made a movie about that but its so monetized you guys sorry i dunno mmhmm affirmative oh okay i didnt do print line yeah it works oh is it going infinite i did  what did you do no bracket on the if statement right there and you keep that bracket and now youre good now okay unresolved okay yeah delete that now its fine okay gucci no thats what you want that works it set the index at  just make sure youre getting different numbers each time and that theyre all in the range and everything i just wanna  it just crawls under this dudes car watch and it just goes right in there australia is fucking crazy oh god how do you i dont understand crosstalk  how do you display all of the array at once well how do we know what they are how do we do that yeah i dont know ill take it tomorrow well just take it off hi if youre listening to this i can see you they change did they okay oh my god did you say your computers better than his well theres still a little bit of daylight outside how are they going to know that youre saying something no they cant no put it on you like the hoodie its going to slide down okay int numbers  to inaudible  no its question  oh  why is it asking me the same god damn question as   oh god damn it god damn it god damn it  i dont know what  is im sorry because youre using the new main the new method that they put up yeah it could be  okay how many questions is this does it exist yeah i think its  maybe we dont have to sort it for binary search right no linear you didnt have to sort it i dont know im asking you yeah you have to sort it should be or compile error because it doesnt make sense so its either negative  or compile error im going to go with compile error oh no its negative  no no it is no im confused im looking at it wait okay okay i need to look at this do you have a calculator okay so it says mid right mid value  for one okay so mid equals low plus high divided by  low plus high divided by  but i dont know what high is what is the length count it        theres nine so the length is  still  okay so its still  so it would be  minus  would be   okay is that option  oh okay you get it yeah put it in eclipse man see what happens is it not  yeah because i wasnt texting they didnt kick me out the program kicked me out what childish its every day but low is zero itd be low plus high yeah mid it says mid mid variable so what are you looking at this mid variable right there  what the fuck is going on perfect what is going on here one of yall can be the group leader to be like stop this right now were going to only talk about coding yeah exactly so stop it meet up with them what for a nap how long has this been going on what have you learned davis exactly i made you do busy work  did you find it prim the texts oh okay  so  right for the first one  no    because youre taking the index right for  and youre trying to find it so mid is  and its asking whats at  no its        exactly int what wheres k  i dont think itll run to be honest with you i dont think itll run if you put int numbers and then you put a decimal in there or if youre trying to find a decimal it would go to  i think just int no arrays why no its the first one no since our key of  is smaller than  yeah so its  is high  is high  for step  no key is  and then key is less than  or   what are you talking about oh well what is mid no no right here mid oh its  its  damn it its  but i thought mid was  yeah is that yeah but mid is  right and you do no no im not saying thats the answer im just saying mid is  right yeah okay im not wrong shes going to come back and be like its fine your gender why so you had to take it oh because you think its easy yes but not binary gender yeah but its only going to be on gender okay i would have done race or poverty uhhuh affirmative but why gender watch youre going to be writing the same thing all over theres nothing more to it what sociology with gender okay you know when you conduct research on sociology you have to ask them about everything you have to ask them about race gender since its social factors social constructs  so you can either choose male female or other yeah so whatever data youre going to have to gather since every research you have to ask the race and gender youre going to have to sort it out why its and why its that its not going to make any sense  what are they going to tell you how gender works or something i dont understand binary because it has to be sorted what are you doing  oh youre going to get mauer there is no stop your screen is red oh sarah for question  i just want to know if were doing this right so far so mid what what is that not it is our first one right what oh okay oh okay okay okay okay crosstalk  no i did not know yall didnt tell me the information i needed to come to a conclusion okay yes we are were going to make it crosstalk  yeah were going to run can you run their might be snakes inaudible  cause we studying so is mid  i thought you just do it    you start and its a      no its  because mid is the index  and you start at  you start at  with the index how is it  so did you do like    see you said it right the first time so now its step  okay so what happens if our mid is equal to  since its the same number like  equals  what does it do now oh return mid since it equals to each other we return  i dont know step  i dont know i really dont know yes no  whatd i say whatd i say crosstalk  you listen to me i got you so step  is  because since you were over here yelling at me saying its an even number and it goes down to a  its  yeah and then you build off of that and then s at  index at  and then since our key is less than  were going to check the bottom half what  listen its loops you know how loops are let me see okay its now  that came from maddie so if were wrong on that its her fault who oh hes high yeah look at his eyes okay  its now  and since you dont understand okay where do you dont understand tell me when to stop this thing okay okay okay okay okay i did that i did that okay okay okay look look look mid you see mid  its going to be low plus high whats high no  oh yeah its  sorry so  divided by  so  its going to always go down so  right there and now its asking since mid is  the index  its trying to find what is at mid so whats at index  whats at index  david what is it okay no im done with that mmhmm affirmative sorry key is  okay and you said  was what math teacher no did yall did you did you mine was too expensive half a page was  dollars half a page but still too expensive i still want a yearbook though so i can make fun of it for your senior year oh he wasnt going to make a burn book i was going to make a burn book a burn book yeah you dont know what the burn book yeah so we all agreed that  is binary search right whats it asking what are yall looking for are you sure thats right prim prim are you sure thats right are you sure because this says repeatedly yeah where it says it are you its the first one okay oh right there first number damn page  ive got to do all this  what page was it again prim    and what okay multiple neighboring huh oh my god what sort what is it no no no its a no no i dont know i dont know i dont think its selection because we just did selection and it doesnt look like that maybe and selection awe this thing again is this the last one damn it yeah thats selection actually i dont know i cant do this whens this due so  its due at  i just wish they had it like that i dont want to keep moving it up  i dont want to do this i dont want to do this i thought you were just going to let me throw it  how do you know the answer how do yall have all the answers are you sure those are the answers was it the group chat oh did you ask you on the group chat are you sure no i mean are you sure about this what i think i got this look look i got this look  fuck you i dont know okay okay so were sorting it from least to greatest so actually i think i mightve done it wrong because the indexes are confusing me so i dont switch up  and  just yet no you didnt for index  you kept it the same as the one before it where do you switch it okay wait  you probably have it more right than me because at  you you switched  with  are you going to go get the answer no i think youre right because yeah because at index  what do you mean you just replaced it in the order that it needs to be in let me see no i think you flip it no if like you betrayed us oh whats  whats  im sorry thats what we did  is negative  right so thats the only ones you got wrong okay okay so i think you swap them like if  is greater than  its going to swap those two positions but the is mean the index right so at  you switch  no its  why oh i already switched okay hold on hold on i did it thats why so at  you switched  and     okay at  and then  would be     yeah yeah is that all that you had to do i printed that oh you had to do two stream the exit document what survey what when was this oh yeah yeah yeah i thought it was like i thought it was like no i didnt know you were talking about the exit form at the end of this class yeah ive been giving you good shit yeah yeah i did i promise you um i dont know why yeah i know um right there zero it should you can make that mmhmm affirmative thats you do a nested loop so it does it both at that random it says its one through nine right i think so crosstalk  numbers between one and nine mmhmm affirmative see that creates the array as like you know how in one dimensional arrays we make it new nth five and then itd be five long well you wouldnt put new array five dot length that creates the whole array and now were just filling it with see right now its empty but its got all the blocks in it and now were just filling it with numbers you dont fill it with c yeah you fill random numbers in but you dont do that because its one through we fill it with numbers one through nine not two through nine uh i mean im trying it ill see if it works but i dont know wait thats were doing one through nine  ten plus one oh doi okay why is that not working uh no cause i havent made it do i have to make it like a string or something yeah how do you do that what is it array im going to ask her and just do main array main array plus okay put the space i believe you main array m c main array yeah assessor yeah so this is what im getting then you put main array in there would it be on the api i see what youre saying so the first two four loops youve got the numbers for the columns and the rows and if we just system out it without a four loop for the no oh yeah wait its supposed to be one through nine and it printed a ten right there mmhmm affirmative that ones one and nine okay what do you need help with right hm yeah well i mean it works let me see if it would work without it since its a nested loop youd do that yeah equals nth to the math dot random times nine plus one calculate the average of numbers in each column of the main array im creating another a separate method to get the average yep and then after the array after main array its brackets yeah yeah uh four and i i is less than main array dot length and then i plus plus and then just put that out crosstalk  in cullowhee theres nothing there my friend my friend used to go there theres a strip mall yeah no one of my friends went there its the drugs are too easy its a low key bop yeah it is its a bit the tuition is  a year mmhmm affirmative  a year housing because yeah they get money off of housing basically hey sarah how do i put a two dimensional array in the parameters i always do dumb stuff thank you is that where you wouldve gone oh what was your second choice my second choice was wilmington or app i got waitlisted and then i just inaudible  i mean i probably wouldve ended up getting rejected but ill never know you do did you not play a sport i did tennis a little bit but i wasnt really committed to it cause we had to play a sport to graduate did you or did you have to do like pe or something okay yeah thats what im doing next year yeah youll die dude what do mean youre going to die there are those people that really thrive living on campus im just not one of them well i think first year its good to stay on campus im glad i stayed on campus first year um im trying to figure out how to get the average of all the just like in part c thats what im trying to figure out no c oh you gotta put i on the bracket after or x whatever you did right there no thats inside i think you why is yours scrolling forever i have no idea oh wait it stopped  i thought it was just you forgot to put x plus plus calculate the average of numbers in each column of the known arrays and store them with some variable i tried to take your guys class but there was a time conflict with itsc it was like the mikhail gorbachev or something like that yeah yeah its been open i dont either are you a sophomore  cause no but its going to work either way i dont know how to do it i dont really know hm no why do you need super glue we get out at  i got rid of the whole method no its going to be random every time were going to i dont know its hard to think this shit through all the way same okay i think i think so yeah thats what mines gonna be like and im only paying  a month no its university north terrace or something like that im sharing it with three of my friends its going to be lit it depends on your lease how much is our what our what yeah i did the math and like a month im paying around  to stay at lynch yeah its almost half that yeah im getting a bike next year im too poor to afford that no im not going to be on campus yeah basically if i do isnt there like some no im going to ride a bike im going to be that guy riding a bike everywhere you dont mind the parking on campus if youre talking about the one in the student union i dont think so i dont pick up super glue its college why do you think ill give it to her you didnt press anything right okay we didnt press anything i dont think  whatd you say thats where literally all my stuff is im not organized at all see if i could pull that up then id show you  its all just in no no its bad  you dont what do you do five fourloop statements no oh wait i dont think you need to create five fourloops yeah right here row is equal to zero and row is going to be incremented by plus one every single time unless row is less than or equal to five its going to be array row times the randomly generated column equals one its just going to fill it each time until it goes through all the rows how do i print it i always forget how to print it i dont think so actually  the moment of truth to do the column you just need one okay thats right we dont index nine crosstalk  crosstalk  do eight right there yeah same thing i dont think thats the problem i dont think making it smaller is going to fix it its line  line  or  well if it says  sometimes the problem in  is because of the line before it im not sure why i got it got it got it i made it less than five instead of just less than crosstalk  six yeah less than five all right it doesnt how come row row row your boat everything  boom look at that amazing i declared my integers outside of the four loop sometimes it does i dont know what the scenarios are but sometimes it sometimes it  mines been perfect every time or it just doesnt work it hasnt fucked up any time since you did that i wouldnt never figured that out dude do you know how to do where you press enter and it runs everything again i dont know no thatll work im just fucking retarded dude yeah i am  what the fuck is wrong with this  crosstalk  press enter yeah not yet im getting there crosstalk  no i didnt but i i went to class without my book bag signed in crosstalk  woke up at    no i went to sleep at  woke up am in the morning i was just chilling then yeah then after that class i came back and then went to sleep  at like  then i took a shower and then came in yeah just i dont have any crosstalk  yes i have they were long but they werent early in the morning
