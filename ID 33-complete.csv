Working.
Yeah. I'm trying to figure out how to use the method thing.
This could be square.
"Yeah, so it makes it more complicated, I think. Oh, wait, that's ... Let's see, double ... Let me see."
Let's see.
Double width equals ...
I think so. But we have to use if/then statements. Just/if statements actually. I think that's how we call them-
Yeah.
That's what I'm trying to do right now.
"Oh, this is going to suck, yeah. I think I got it to work for the square."
"Square [inaudible 00:31:58], yeah. So I just need to do that again for rectangle and then those other shapes. So I did the actual math part and its own method. The if statements, I put the ... What'd I do? See, I don't even know what I did because that's just a bunch of ..."
"But the if/then statement is where I actually ask them for the side for the measurements, and that's where I actually stored it."
"Yeah, this is in the main method. Then the square method is only the math part."
Yeah.
"No, I didn't do that."
Did you do that?
"Oh, really?"
"Oh, 10 points. That's a lot of points if it is."
I should start doing that.
"Oh, yeah. I guess it's 10 points in all."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Really?
I probably should do it.
Because that test was rough.
Yeah.
"Yeah, and we still have another one right here."
Oh.
That's tough.
"Oh yes. Okay, I got the rectangle party"
"Yeah, and I added another variable because you need the width and the length. Now for the triangle."
"This is very tedious. [inaudible 00:44:22] [crosstalk 00:45:33] Okay, I think I got A for the first one, if you want to see it. Let me see if it runs. Okay, the second program is a little easier I think."
Yeah.
It's just telling ... Seeing if it's odd or even.
"But the first one, look how many lines of code. My coding is really inefficient, but it works."
Do you want me to send you this?
How's yours?
"I'll put it in a Word document. Oh. Yeah. Here, you can take down your email. Oh."
"Alright, that's mine. Should we even do the second one? Or do it later? I kind of want to do it later."
What?
Yeah.
"Oh, what time is it?"
Oh my.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"Oh yeah yeah. That method, yeah."
That's how it can compare it without the-
"No, it wasn't in the book. You had to look on the website. That's how I found it."
"I know, right? That's basically how I learn in this class."
It's just searching it up online.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
[inaudible 00:51:45]
Yes.
33
Let's see if it works right.
"So yeah, I think we need a loop for that."
Write set list. For all of ... Hold on. [inaudible 00:57:43].
"Split. Oh, I think I know how to do that. I can find out how many what is it called? How many characters there are, and then just divide it by two. So and then I could use ... What is that method where you can display only up to a certain index. Then I can use that number and halve it."
Okay. Let's do this. Okay.
Yes. Finally.
"I mean, we messed up a lot. [crosstalk 01:17:44]"
We got a hundred on them. [inaudible 01:19:35] [crosstalk 01:19:39] Yeah. That's why I've been taking screenshots.
Oh well.
"Yeah. It is confusing, because you have to do a loop and then an if statement within that loop."
"That would be confusing too, but I'll start on that. So basically after the [inaudible 01:24:04] I think it's 4.5. I'm a genius."
Today is the last day to drop?
For what?
Oh yeah. That's a lot of points.
Yeah. [inaudible 01:31:17]
Yeah. You can make a 76 and still make an A. I think - nevermind. I don't know what happens in this class. I know that test brought me down a lot.
"Yeah. I made something like that. It's like really bad, but then the last test was okay. I think I got a B on that or something like that, so that kind of averaged it out. I don't know, and the assignment."
"Yeah. [crosstalk 01:32:09] No, no I was right. Not you. [inaudible 01:33:21]"
Ah you can't do substrate? That's what I was doing. Bruh.
"Yeah, 'cause that's what I was going to do, the substrate, but I guess we can't. I don't see how else you could do it though. [crosstalk 01:39:34] I guess we could do it with - [crosstalk 01:40:40]"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Roberts at the bar.
"Well I didn't use a method though, this ..."
Yeah.
"Oh yes, I forgot it's recording."
"You need to write the cognitive method in the ... See, they didn't use a method."
Why use method four?
Do you have any idea?
"I don't think you could put the four looped in it, can you?"
Do you want me to email you the program?
"I know, right?"
Yeah. Exactly.
Yeah. I'm a little scared for that test.
"Yeah, I am too."
Yeah. (laughter)
Let's see about it.
Man.
Should I ask for [crosstalk 02:00:08] ... ?
Let me do my exit and then I'll [inaudible 02:00:16].
"[inaudible 02:00:34] stressed I am, seeing, smiling [inaudible 02:00:39] ..."
Yeah.
"Yay, she's coming out."
"Yeah. Oh, we finished."
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah. Awesome.
"Oh man, this again? Now we can't cuss."
"Yeah, near the end."
(laughter)
"Yeah, she says she listens to all of them, so I don't know."
"Yeah, that's like what, an hour each?"
Yeah.
"So, is this good for core A?"
What's up.
"Okay, thank you."
I think that should ...
Yeah. Find the maximum byte duration [crosstalk 02:13:50] ...
What does he mean by find the maximum value of array by showing it's value and index of [crosstalk 02:14:33] ...
Okay.
So ...
"So, it just tells you what's the highest number?"
"Okay, thank you."
Go for it.
Lets see ...
Use [inaudible 02:17:32] songs [inaudible 02:17:34] ...
Yep.
Did you [crosstalk 02:37:21].
Are you skipping [inaudible 02:37:26].
"Finish the ad version, not sure if I did this right."
All right. So I'll do that and the bottom one.
"Oh wow, that's simple. 'Cause I did this whole mess."
I put in a different [crosstalk 02:38:04] method.
"Yeah, so ..."
Did you do the maximum? The part B part yet?
'Cause I'm not sure if I did it right. So I want to see.
"I mean, I think, did I switch it? Oh no they put max for this. [crosstalk 02:39:11]. I don't think I did that whole [crosstalk 02:39:11] right. [crosstalk 02:39:11]. No, I just need to find the elements that are higher than the average."
That's already done.
All right [crosstalk 02:39:44].
"Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out 'cause that's a little much for me. [crosstalk 02:40:12]. Maybe you have to do an if statement actually. Like if the number is ..."
"Yeah, [crosstalk 02:41:18]."
Really?
"Wow, and then we just have our final every day?"
The second?
Then next year. That kind of sucks 'cause then we have to summary and then we probably forget everything.
Oh yeah.
Really?
Oh.
What?
Really?
It's the same? Okay-
"[crosstalk 02:43:22]. Well, this is okay."
"So it's basically a continuation, it's not really-"
What?
"Wow, that's really-"
Yeah. I thought this is complicated.
Yeah. [crosstalk 02:43:59].
Yeah.
All right [crosstalk 02:44:15].
They posted it?
Oh. I thought it was okay. I didn't have enough time so I couldn't [crosstalk 02:44:43]. Oh yeah. There was one I couldn't get and I just left it out. I just skipped over it.
"Yeah. That was tough. The beginning, like the part A, I stuck on that for-"
"Yeah. And then after that I was like, God dammit. We have to do this whole thing after-"
So I couldn't finish it. There was one [crosstalk 02:45:28] just skipped it. [crosstalk 02:45:30].
Yeah. It's going to take-
"Yeah, I was pretty bummed when I read the thing [crosstalk 02:46:08] wow."
"Yeah, this is really-"
I'm trying to figure out how to put the new values in the new array. So it says that we have to find all the values that are higher than the average and then we have to put it in a new array and another array. So I have to figure out how to do that. [crosstalk 02:46:44].
Yeah. [crosstalk 02:46:52].
I have no idea.
"I don't know, this is so hard."
"Yeah, me too. [crosstalk 02:47:42]."

"Oh, yeah. Searching? Okay. "
Thank you. I think it's linear and then binary. 
"Why is this... Oh, it doesn't have anything there. If K equals... "
"Yeah, that's what I-"
"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, but selection saved. [crosstalk 00:03:40] Selections."
Okay. [crosstalk 00:04:05] Let's say these were in the method. 
77?
"I'm guessing they're using this number as an index number, but I'm not sure. Did you put it in? "
This wouldn't work because it doesn't tell us what the method is. It doesn't show us a method. It only shows us the main methods. 
I think. I have no idea. We had three attempts. 
"That's true. Yeah. I don't know why it would be three or one or negative one. So I'm thinking it's 77 because I'm thinking they might use this as an index number and the index at three, zero, one, two, three, 77. "
"Okay, let's say our main method looks like this. I think it's negative one. I think when it's out of range, doesn't it return negative one or something like that?"
I'm totally guessing because I'm not sure. 
"Yeah, let me test that out. I'll just put a random thing in the other method. [crosstalk 00:06:23] Oh, no!"
"I hope that's like, it's dropping them and can we just honestly leave those down here? No, that's not going to work. "
I put it right here. Do you think it can still hear us?
Yeah. 
Just leave it down here. 
"Yeah, a lot. Okay. [crosstalk 00:07:26] Oh, wait. Is that what it's doing? Oh, wait. Maybe I was wrong for this one. Maybe you're right that this is one. Yeah."
"Like, the actual index of where three is. That would be zero and then one. Then this would be also negative one because there's none in there. Yeah, I think you're right. Then this would be three and six. [crosstalk 00:09:20] "
Wouldn't this be binary? Because it divides it by two? For question seven?
"Bubble for it, what? [crosstalk 00:10:53] "
"Okay, thank you. [crosstalk 00:11:40] Do you think that's a thing they just made up? Or is it actually a thing?"
Oh. 
"Oh, yeah. [crosstalk 00:12:21] Oh, okay. It does it one after another, so it just switches that. So, one is less than... So it switches it. And then four is less than five, so it switches it. So it does it one-by-one. The two pairs. So it's very simple, actually. "
I didn't get that. [crosstalk 00:13:02] 
"What? Yeah, this is what I found out. Eight is going back to this question right here at six. "
"Yeah. Okay, now I have to go back and... let's see eight. [crosstalk 00:16:00] Zero? What? [crosstalk 00:16:23]"
Since it's what?
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Oh, that makes sense, yeah. That means nine would be-"
"Thus, resulting in a compiler error. "
Okay. 
"Oh, whoa. [crosstalk 00:17:53] This is still going back to... eight. "
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). [crosstalk 00:18:18] All right, [inaudible 00:18:54]. So it's four, right? [crosstalk 00:19:16] 53. Since our... [crosstalk 00:19:50] Our new high variable is now at two. What? [crosstalk 00:21:05] "
"That equals two. [crosstalk 00:22:20] Three, four, five, six seven. [crosstalk 00:22:44] Zero, one, two, three, four. Three? No, that's on here. Ah, this is... The low is here, zero. Zero, one, two, three, four. So wouldn't it be three? Seven. Zero, one, two, three. Oh, was... What did you put for the mid to be three?"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Wait, if key is less than... high equals six. Ugh. [crosstalk 00:24:58] So key is six. Six is less than 33. Yes, high equals mid. [crosstalk 00:27:20] X plus..."
I got 33. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). So before I got it equals two. That's what I think. 
"Yes, at four. "
Yeah. 
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Well, on the actual code it says, ""Low plus high, and high is seven,"" because this subtracts one for some reason. That would equal seven; it divides it by two, so wouldn't that be 3.5, but it turns into three? Then... where am I going with this? Oh yeah, I forgot what I was saying. [crosstalk 00:29:48]"
"Oh, okay. Then it subtracts one so the high equals two because their mid was three, and it subtracts one so it's two. "
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:30:06] This is what I got. 
What?
"Oh, yeah. This is what I'm guessing. "
"Mm-hmm (affirmative), that's what I'm thinking and I put it in the ID and it returned one. "
It's like the smallest... [crosstalk 00:34:27]
Way back on 23. [crosstalk 00:34:40]
"Oh, that's so hard. "
Okay. This is a bubble one? I feel like that might be a bubble sort. An [immerse 00:36:04] sort? [crosstalk 00:36:05] Yeah. Yikes. I'm going to look at the code for this. 
"Bubble, right? "
"Yeah, this one's the one that looks really complicated, this one. [crosstalk 00:38:12]"
What?
Come on internet. 
"That's what I think. To this one, the sorting stuff code. "
"Yeah. No, it's fine. It's just frustrating. "
I forgot this was on. Five. 
Yeah. 
"Of course she'll say it's easy. She's the... [crosstalk 00:40:16] I, O, K, and I. [crosstalk 00:40:35] "
Yeah. That's how much... [crosstalk 00:41:00] 
"Oh, wow. "
"Oh, he... Oh my gosh. I thought there was only a few, but apparently there's a lot more. "
"Yeah, me neither. I'm trying to figure out what exactly it's wanting. [crosstalk 00:42:54] K equals... And I equals zero. Swap... [crosstalk 00:43:50] Five, two. [crosstalk 00:44:48] I'm just going to skip it and go back to it. "
That's a lot of points. [crosstalk 00:47:00] 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). [crosstalk 00:48:01] 
Sure. 










33
Nothing. 
I don't want to send out my Google. 
I think it's the column.
[inaudible 00:06:59]
An array.
"Sorry. Oh, you used [crosstalk 00:12:38]."
"Okay, that's what I was thinking too. "
Nothing.
[crosstalk 00:15:07] calculating each row?
I can't even get to [crosstalk 00:29:44].
"I was just trying to see if I can... Oh wait, because I have a... I haven't even opened this yet. That's what happened to them."
I got you. 
Can't even get it to add.
"How would you [crosstalk 00:30:33], since you have multiples?"
"How would you do that if you randomly generate it? If you didn't have to randomly generate it, it would be a lot easier to do."
I don't know how we do one or two.
[crosstalk 00:45:09]
"Wait, is this... because this [inaudible 00:45:22] to roll two, setting that to i, but how do you set..."
"How do you set the first one to the roll that you created? You know, because this is randomly generated."
"No, no, no. You know, [crosstalk 00:45:57]."
"Each row, right?"
"So how do you tell it? Because it's randomly generated, so you don't know how many rows there are. So you won't know how many... You won't be able to tell, A at row two, you know? Because this, right here, is showing me how to add row two. It's about everything row two."
I don't know how to...
"Yeah, because it's random. So I'm just trying to figure out..."
[inaudible 00:46:57]
"Yeah, that's not right. It should be less than that."
[crosstalk 00:48:36]
It says that you [crosstalk 00:48:56].
"This is the random generator, and this as well."
[inaudible 00:50:39]
"Yeah, just something's wrong with them."
"It looks like it's not right, right there."
Sorry.










33. Okay. [crosstalk 00:00:16]. 
Yeah. 
I'm not [crosstalk 00:00:48] don't say that. [crosstalk 00:00:53]. 
... And then the next four of them [crosstalk 00:09:19]. 
Or possibly give more [crosstalk 00:09:54]. 
"Yeah, I basically did [crosstalk 00:11:21]. Right, and then [crosstalk 00:11:29]. "
"Yeah, [crosstalk 00:17:16]. "
"It's me bro, what else did I [crosstalk 00:19:14]. "
I think we're good. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:20:55]. 
65 to [crosstalk 00:25:31]. 
No wonder [crosstalk 00:33:26]. 
I was just curious about that. 
"Yeah, we should probably do those at least the pattern. "
"No, that's where I was, yeah. "
I guess we just do it [crosstalk 00:44:05] and just call. 
Then you just call and it's [crosstalk 00:44:11]. 
"Yeah, we did the first one- "
We just answered it this way- 
He came just in time [crosstalk 00:49:45] I guess. [crosstalk 00:49:45]- 
Is he okay? 
He wasn't in the lab [crosstalk 00:52:17]. 
Same thing [crosstalk 00:53:02]. 
That's what we tried to do. 
Okay. 
"That's the confusing part [crosstalk 00:56:46]. Yeah, thank you. [crosstalk 00:56:48]. Thank you. "
"Yeah, thank you. [crosstalk 00:57:54]. "
You have [crosstalk 00:58:54]. 
Is that what they want us to do? 
Yeah. [crosstalk 01:00:17]. 
Is that right? [crosstalk 01:01:03]. Well I guess you can. [crosstalk 01:01:31]. 
 33. [inaudible 00:00:22].
[crosstalk 00:03:06].
"When you make an array, [crosstalk 00:09:07]."
[crosstalk 00:10:50].
[crosstalk 00:10:59].
[crosstalk 00:11:05].
It automatically feels easier. [crosstalk 00:19:21].
[crosstalk 00:23:22].
It's supposed to [inaudible 00:44:40] they all align. Right?
One [crosstalk 00:44:57].
