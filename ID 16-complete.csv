Okay.
"It says ""draw the flow chart"" but it doesn't say ""submit the flow chart"" anywhere. So... "
I'm just going to not. [inaudible 00:00:32]... shape and its dimensions.
"Do you think when it says ""conditional statements"" do you think that allows switch statements?"
"It says under the ""to do this you need to"" the third bullet says ""in the main method you "
"will use conditional statement."" Does that include switch statements? I hope so."
"Yeah. I hope that doesn't mean just, uh, [inaudible 00:01:25]. This one should be easier."
"Aw, wait. He just said we have to use if-L statements. I don't want to use If-else statements.[crosstalk 00:03:11]"
"What's the thing you can do for, like, what's the thing you can do to do new lines and "
Backslash?
And then end. Do you have to put anything inside of it or do you just leave it?
"Oh, is it."
"Oh, oh!"
You put it in the quotes?
So you just do-
And then you just keep on
"Yeah, I don't know [inaudible 00:04:01] is this one supposed to be this way?"
Oh. That just depends how you want it I guess. If you put a space there'll be an extra space. So it just depends how you want it. [crosstalk 00:04:33]
"Alright, we've gotten that taken care of. [crosstalk 00:05:12]"
"I'm just trying to put it, make a line so [inaudible 00:05:22]"
I'm just going to get some water.
Yeah.
"Okay. Ah, so. I'm going to need a few integers so N's your radius, and with length, width, base, height, because we have triangles too. I guess I'm just thinking if I like, you know[crosstalk 00:06:23]"
So anyways.
I was just going to do the condition for deciding which method it's going to use. I was 
just going to do that first. I'll just do the methods after.
Yeah. I heard him talking to someone else earlier saying they want us to use ifs. So.
"So I'd just be like if, assign me my variable shape, if shape is equal to the one, then we're doing... So what does it want us to tell them?"
"Okay, so just the area, okay. So you can just make it be like system L [crosstalk "
"00:07:29]. Oh wait, so now that its a square you're not going to be like enter the length and width. Length, undo length, then width. Feeling more specific?"
So that one we squared. [crosstalk 00:07:48] Length equals we put dot [inaudible 
00:07:48] and then width equals [inaudible 00:08:12]
"Oh! Yeah. I guess I hear it. You can just change it to length/width. Because, you know, "
"they're the same, and then just only take one of the end parts."
"Yeah, the length, yeah. Yeah, whatever. Semantics. It doesn't really matter."
"So after it reads that it should just do. I'm trying to remember how to, okay just the "
name of it. So it'll give you an error until you write it but I'm just going to write it down 
"because, all I'm going to do is print. I'm just going to make it, I'm going to name the "
"function square, and then it's going to be an integer so it's going to be square. So I'm "
just gooing to leave it as that. It's going to yell at you for right now because it's not there 
but I'm just going to leave it until...
"Yeah we're going to make a method eventually, but its just not there yet. I just decided "
I'm going to name the method squares. I just put it in as it's going to be when I run it.
"Oh, no, no."
"square. Because it should be a one variable method, so. So if shade equals equals"
two...so we're just going to be doing the same thing basically. Over and over...
For this you can just do ifs.
"If you really want to you could just put one else at the end where its like, if its not any of "
"these then you can put an else that just says, like, invalid entry or something. Like we "
used to do with switch statements back then.
"See this one makes much more sense as a switch statement, but whatever. So 2 is "
"rectangle, yeah. Enter the, so this one actually needs length and width."
Then width of the rectangle.
"So then this one is just rectangle, length, width."
"Width, shape, equals three... oops."
"Yeah. So now, this is the same right here as"
"No, see, when you call a method right. So methods, you know, they require two certain "
points and it gives you certain output. But when you have you have to call it you have to 
specify what you're using as the inputs and that's what that is. You do the name of the 
"method and then, so for example, rectangle when we make it will be a two variable "
method where it just multiplies them together. But it needs you to-
What you put in the parentheses after it those are the variables it will take when it calls the method.
"Yeah, but that's just what you draw, that's what you want it to print. All that's just "
"where I put like the area is and then that, but yeah."
It's going to return the result of the method.
Yeah.
"I think you guys when you write that you're basically writing ""give me the result if you "
"were to run that method with these numbers."" That's like what that means. So that is "
like shorthand for that whole method using those two numbers. [inaudible 00:13:31].
"So anyways, done with that. Almost done with the easy part."
Alright did you finish that part? The [inaudible 00:15:27]
"So now, we have to do the, actually make the methods now. Which is the harder part."
"Alright so, I'm trying to remember the syntax for those little parts, okay. Public, static. Okay, yes."
"So we'll start with public, static. So we have the in- the thing right before the mean, that "
"is the output type? Yes, output type. Doubled, yes. So many integers. So let's start with "
"a square. Then you, so that's your- I can't use length again can I? No you can't. Okay."
What's the problem here friend? Syntax error.
"Yeah, in the square, it doesn't like that. I'm not sure why."
"[crosstalk 00:17:16] No. Public, static."
"Yeah, hold on. Mine doesn't like that though. Here, I'm going to bring up the text book. "
"It doesn't like something. Public, static, name. Why don't you like that? Alright, let's try this instead."
"Okay, this. Hm. Public, static, ent. Yeah, so what's wrong with this? Who. I worry, is it "
"just because I haven't written anything? Is that like, if I just do like..."
Hm. Move your val model from full model for parameter squared. Is it just like the name? Really…
Hm.
"See, okay. I don't know mine-"
"Yeah, no. I'm just- there's something wrong with mine where it just doesn't like any of this."
"Did you actually finish it, no hurry?"
Alright I'll try that first. And see if that lets it in.
Okay.
"Yeah, so."
And area equals...
So the return area...
"Hey, I know what it is. I fixed it. I failed to close the other method."
"You have to close your, if you're going to do another method, you have use another "
"semi-colon to close the original method. Oh, look. And I just take out the semi-colon "
"that's closing the other one, that's why it's yelling at me again. I put it back, it's gone. It's "
"because this is a part of the, this public static void method, and it was, you have to close it."
"You must have, you must have put an extra semi-colon somewhere and that's making it work."
Because that was making mine not work. I don't know how you would have got around that.
Oh I didn't put that back.
"Okay so, now all you have to do is just go-"
"Yeah, within each method you can reuse-"
Yeah. It wouldn't matter anyways because it only uses one every time the program runs.
Yeah. Rectangle. ENT-X.
ENT. Triangle. ENT-whoops! ENT-X. ENT-1...ENT area equals X times Y times 1 divided by two. One half base times height. Return area.
That's probably good enough.
I don't know...
ENT oops.
ENT-Area.
"Oh yeah. Pi R, it's Pi R squared, right? Pi R Squared."
So I would just do 3.14 times... times radius... Where is radius highlighted in red?
"That's weird. Oh, wait. Because nevermind. I'm [inaudible 00:25:44]. I know exactly why its highlighted."
"When you do power, as in power-"
Is math capitalized?
MATH.pow and then-
"Oh, really?"
"Pi R squared. Pi R squared. Pi... Oh, oops. I didn't have to do that. Well we can fix that, we just need to change some variables around."
"Return. Area. There we go. Ah, too many of these. Yeah, so is this saying its going to tell "
"me, yep. Okay, we can fix that."
"So, it's just, when you do math methods, it's kind of confusing but these variables-"
"Those are, yeah. So like, for example-"
"I mean, you can because when you define them here they're only defined for the "
"You can but like, I was just trying to do this because I feel like that for like later, more "
complicated things might be better to just-
But-
"Can you do multiplication like you do in like, try instead of putting-"
Just try putting a multiplication sign between the pi and that instead of- maybe it's 
"getting- oh, now it's getting, I've broken all of it. Area equals pi times-"
Yeah.
Oh you need to make area a double. You need to make it-
"You need to make it return a double too, so change it from public static in to public static double."
"Alright, I'm clean on errors now. I'm going to try this."
"So I'm going to try all of them square. 5 times 5, 25. Alright. So let's try a rectangle. 5 "
"and 4 should be 20. Alright, good. Let's try a triangle. Alright it's 4 by 2. Zero. Okay, well "
my triangle is broken apparently.
"Yeah, I put in 4 and 2 and got zero."
I did 1/2 times base times height.
"You might want to put parentheses about, around 1 divided by 2, because that can be "
an order of operations problem. I think it might be because its an integer. I'm going to 
try converting this one to a double as well.
"Yeah. We're dividing, so. Uh, let's try that. 4, 2, I got 0.0."
"Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with this it should not be giving us that."
"What happens if I so, [crosstalk 00:30:07]"
"Okay, so it must be a problem in our- I'm going to do this the long way because length is "
area divided by 2. Alright this should fix it.
"I'm doing it, I did it the easy way. Yep, see there you go. I just did that. Two lines that are on."
Yeah.
"Either way, those work. I'm not going to calculate. I'm just going to put a number and "
see if it sounds right. That's probably about right.
"Put in 2, see what you get. Yep! 12.57. I'm .01 off, but I don't care."
"Oh it's, this is easy. You should just do another... system.out. ENT-LN. So, Leaving..."
So another...
"Oh, did it? Where there? Oh I thought it meant like take your answer you already got "
"and check that. No, it's just another one."
"Okay, that's easier. That might be actually kind of hard, but no."
I have no clue.
"Enter N, Enter [inaudible 00:33:10]...ENT, uh. Equals input. Max ENT. All we have to do "
for that is do system.ENT.printLN... Alright so I just need to be sure and make a method. 
Call it even. Just want to call it mine. Public. Static. What data types can you all put in a 
method. Can you do like a string? Can I return a string?
It can return a string?[crosstalk 00:34:22]
Well we're going to find out.
"Returned, oh I forgot to put a name on it... There we go. String cannot be resolved to a type."
"Oh, string is capitalized..."
Okay if X...
Oops.
So now we just have it... re-out. Return. And save. [inaudible 00:36:29] to resolve to a variable. Excuse me?
Oops... Alright
"I just did, I just did this. Huh."
"Alright, well that's about it for me then. Guess we're about done."
It runs.
"Uh, just about, yeah."
Yeah we do.
"Oh, you need to say the numbers."
"16. Hope that works. Anyways, yeah okay."
"Uh, no. He did."
"Anyways. Um. Yeah, so that works. I probably could have been a little more graceful, but "
"I forgot about doing like the part 1, part 2. So. But whatever."
"I hate doing the long chains of like [inaudible 00:42:05]cat and sub-string and stuff, but I don't know. It works."
"Yeah, we have to do the flow charts apparently and I think they wanted us to do... "
"I think he only wanted us for the first one not both of them, so. That saves us a little bit of time"
I got it.
You having a problem? Did you declare in some?
Yeah you did.
It's working now.
"Alright, I'm going to do the student code, or whatever. Yep, right, [inaudible 00:43:29] gonna do…"
Yeah.
But I been- want to do for the first one.
"No, you did not just die on me."
Piece of garbage. I'm back now. I have a charger. It's a matter of if I can find a place to plug it in.
"Oh is it? [inaudible 00:45:10]. I, if this is all the way it goes this spring. Well, okay. At "
minimum you assume it would save because it saves every time it runs.
"So most of all is probably saved. In fact, all of it's probably saved except the student codes."
"No, I usually just like, well I guess [inaudible 00:45:37] tedious description of exactly what it does."
Who wrapped this up so early?? This is a[inaudible 00:45:46].
"Oh, no I would just do one and just say that it does it for every one."
"Alright. Barry, come back to me please."
I very much just don't want to do anything hard.
"Oh hey! It didn't even actually turn off it just went into sleep mode, so."
Okay.
So it meets... sorry.
"Alright, well. The rest will sort of go."
"So much neater, like this. Collapse it all up, and done. Anyways."
How do you do methods in flow charts? I don't know that's a good question. Huh. Um... yeah.
Going be 16 [inaudible 00:49:44].
"Uh, I usually just do like, string."
"Wait, is there a reason why I can't just do this?"
What could you possibly do without- unless you- how could you possibly do that without a sub-string? What the hell?
"No, see. That's BS."
It just says you cannot use script. That doesn't mean you don't sub-string.
Okay I have no idea how you can possibly set sub-string.
"Yeah, I feel like she didn't. It doesn't say that it. It says you can't use spark but it sub-string. Yeah I'm just going to leave it there. And I'm just be like the thing says it "
"Ah. Anyways. How's the flow chart look, okay. So we have-"
"Yeah, cause nobody wants to [inaudible 00:54:18]."
"No I said no one wants the first one, so."
Um.
"Oh, yeah. This probably isn't very good for writing a flow chart, is it?"
"Um. Yikes. Yeah. I realize that now, unfortunately."
Oh. How did it get to 8:00 so fast?
Hm.
[inaudible 00:55:55]
Alright. Same.
"I mean, yeah. I mean. This is basically it. It's just, it's convoluted."
"Yeah. I mean, yeah. That's more or less it. It's just, yeah... This is so slow."
Alright. Oh yeah so you can just send me the picture of that.
"You emailed me once before, didn't you?"
"Okay. That's sensible. We should probably shut this off then, shouldn't we?"
Alright. I need to move to on. [inaudible 01:00:48]... If anything changes on our list from the 
So the first one has to do that one-
"Yeah, because see in that one, if anything changes in either list 1 or list 2, both will "
"update in this one and in 2, if list 1 changes, that won't change list 2. I don't think."
"Oh okay, cool. [inaudible 01:01:17] okay. Almost done. Let's take the other method and then-"
A new one. [inaudible 01:01:30] past how we do this. [inaudible 01:01:33]
Make a copy of the past work [inaudible 01:02:20]...
"I think it's the first one. Anyway[inaudible 01:02:20]. Sync. Well, that worked."
Define in your way of string the entire [inaudible 01:02:28] names. Read a search method
Font name search. [inaudible 01:02:28] array of string data. Okay. That doesn't seem too bad.
TIFA-T [inaudible 01:03:04].
"Okay. Um. It says ten names, right?"
Ent-over [inaudible 01:03:48]
So we can just use a loop so-
"String. Uh, names."
No I think-
"I think you, I think it starts at zero as far as how it counts, but that number you put in is "
how many slots total you want. So I think it's still 10.
"Um, String 10. Okay then. We need another string. So, the idea is that you- ten names "
"from the user. And then it searches for the name, okay so."
"It switches the string [inaudible 01:05:09] index of the name. Okay, so now get them to enter the name of the search."
Enter the name of the search. Oh I need to do the entering the names first. Forgot all that. [inaudible 01:05:24] for that.
I is less than 10. Then...I plus this. Names. I. [inaudible 01:05:57] oops.
"Yeah I'd use just the just .next, but yeah. I figure names are usually one word long, but "
yeah. It doesn't probably matter.
"So then we can just do, whoops. String name- String, I don't know. Key equals m.next "
You have to enter the name they're looking for.
"Alright so. Now we need to make a method. So, system.out.print[inaudible 01:07:13] "
"name, underscore, search. Oh, the arguments being- names. And, um, names and then "
"key. And I have to declare that. Down here. Public. Static. Uh, that returns a ENT. Uh, "
"name, underscore, search. Um. String. How do you declare methods and have a raise in "
"them, that's like, oh. ENT. It's what type it is. Okay so, string. Name. String. Q. Return. "
Index. [inaudible 01:08:26]. ENT. Indux equals zero.
"Hm. I know where this [inaudible 01:08:50]. Oh, wait, hold on. This is near the brackets. "
"Yeah, there we go. Um, okay so now it just needs to do your search or whatever. So 4 "
"ENT-I equals zero. I is less than 10. I ++. If... if uh, names. I. P. Index, oh wait, hold on. It "
needs to return the index.
"Oh yeah. So. Index equals I. Uh, the name [inaudible 01:10:34]? The name is in index of the list."
"Uh, I mean yeah. More or less. I think it's a little simplified, actually. Well I mean that is "
"for searching numbers, this is for just searching. It's just comparing every space in the "
"array to what you're looking for, and when it finds it, it just tells you what slot it was in "
when it found them.
Maybe. Do you have that returning anything yet? It won't work until it's returning 
something. I'm going to check this real quick.
Joan. Pearl. Self.[inaudible 01:11:35]
"Uh, oh. That didn't work. Hm."
Yeah.
Wants you to tell you where-
"I don't know why this isn't working. Index zero. Oh, what, no."
"it's whatever. I can just do this.Well if index equals I, then, it's the same thing. Probably an unnecessary variable, but "
"Just because you have to declare it doesn't mean, you can just declare things to zero, "
you don't have a problem with things not working for whatever reason.
-you don't really
I'm going to change it. I mean it's kind of-
I just put it there because that's where my train of thought was going at the time.
I don't know why this isn't working. This doesn't make any sense. [inaudible 01:13:54]...
"Okay so now it works... 0. 1. 2. Okay, well mine works."
"Alright, that's that one. What's wrong with yours? Is something wrong with it?"
Is it just not finding it even if it's there?
"Let me see it again. Yeah, see okay. When I hit mine doing equals equals, it wasn't working. Here try it onlu equals-"
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah. Okay. Well. You can do what I did. I changed it from equals equals to .contains key, and for some reason that works .equals equals. [inaudible 01:16:58]. Yeah that "
"works for me when equals equals didn't. I don't know why. I want to take, yeah. Just putting in single letters that looks the best."
"Alright, well, there you go. Alright[inaudible 01:17:53] already. I guess we should- they "
told us to raise our hand to get the things taken off alright.
"Oh, dang. We got some Pokemon here."
"Ah, you're good."
We're finished.
Yeah.
Yes.
