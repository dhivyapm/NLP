"Yeah, March 14."
"Okay. And you are Team 8, or Group 8."
Yeah.
Perfect. Thank you.
Okay.
I'd just like to [inaudible 00:00:18] you the program [inaudible 00:00:20].
What did you say? Where?
"Yeah, I mean that's like ""if"" statements and stuff, conditional."
"Okay, first get the scanner. Um. Enter."
"Wait, is this one small?"
[inaudible 00:03:11]
"Did you do that as a string? I mean, are you doing it as a string, for like, [inaudible "
That's this one.
Yeah.
"You have it like, do it-"
Like touching. Which one do you-
You put it in-
"You have to um, [inaudible 00:03:41]"
"Yes, base and then-"
"Well, you keep the LN like on that statement. So you don't want it there, so like space from that and then put the LN, well then you can have that out. We'll just run it and make sure."
Nope. It usually has to have it like touching the other one.
"Okay. Oh, I can see. So did you do, are you doing..."
Okay.
"Okay, so I'm guessing you wouldn't have to use methods for this, I'm assuming."
"So not just if-n saying [crosstalk 00:05:43] three of the circles are here. Yeah, Pi R squared."
We should do... let me pull up the book.
Like how the book-
Use the if statement to decide which method to use?
"So, like, if..."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"Well, if it was square it's just a side so it would equal the same thing."
"We'll just say into the length of side, of one side or something."
Should we leave it as that and not the... Are we making a whole nother method?
"Oh, I didn't see. I thought you were just putting them as when."
"Oh no, you just-"
"Is it not else-if, or does it matter?"
Okay.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Where did you have it print? [inaudible 00:11:49]
"Wait, will you say like, rectangle length, width is going to be returning two different things?"
Okay so when you call it [crosstalk 00:12:39]
"But if its printing this out, isn't it printing out the answer?"
And then its going to return length and width?
Okay.
Um.
"Oh, yeah that's right."
You and the first one.
What do you mean?
Like this?
I did it like...
"Does this work, or did I do it define area here."
that one made this one not red anymore.
"Well, mine was like that first and then I finish-"
Yeah I finished mine.
"Yeah, so I just did the public, static, and square under it and LEN and then I defined area. Like that."
I think that's how it works.
And then I do the same thing for...
I did the same thing for the rectangle.
"And then, um. Like-"
What do you mean?
"I didn't do that, though."
Hm.
"Yeah, okay."
ENT-IT. Ent- Base.
I can define the area in each of them right?
"Okay, yeah."
"Okay, yeah yeah yeah."
Half done...
I think that's right.
"Is there a, do I just hit the [inaudible 00:24:40] for mine, or is there like?"
Okay.
"Ah, defined everything."
You can't do the power because everythings in ENT and everything's doubles.
Yeah so you just have to do pi. Then you do R times [inaudible 00:25:17]
Hm?
3.14 is [inaudible 00:25:50] doubled [crosstalk 00:25:53]
It's MATH.pow
Yeah. It is-
But it says that it can't do it because ENT [inaudible 00:26:09]
Yeah.
I don't know why this is like this. I did- I keep getting...
"Wait, where do you get X and Y?"
They correlate to the-
"Oh, so I was supposed to put-"
"Oh, okay."
Okay but it keeps saying I-
Its like underlined and its not something for this unit.
"It says ""pi N is undefined for the type develop math."" I don't know what that means. It says create a method pi, but I don't wanna do that. I thought maybe declaring it or something like that."
Cannot convert from double to in- I'm not asking you to convert. Oh! Because this will 
give you a decimal because this is 3.14.
So do we need to just make this one-
Oh!
There we go.
"Okay, I got it."
Your triangle is broken?
"How did you do it? I just did, I did-"
"I just didn't want to whatever, whatever."
"Yeah, I was going to say, because that because [crosstalk 00:29:35] because 1 divided by 2. It's-"
"Oh, I got 0.0 now."
When I- let me see without the parentheses.
"-I don't know what its supposed to be. Like, let me see. Um."
"Okay, I got it. It's- you don't have the parentheses around the 1/2. I looked it up just to make sure because I don't know how to do it."
"Oh, so you did the-"
"-double area. Area divided by 2, oh okay."
I can look it up.
Okay...There was a second problem.
Without the program running like which checks whether integers even or odd. Okay. Enter A integer.
"Yeah this is like a whole different, yeah."
Is this the one?
I think it is. [inaudible 00:33:02]
[inaudible 00:34:19] a string because
I'm pretty sure I saw that.
Yeah... Okay. If num...
Um.
"Okay I did, um... what do I..."
"Okay, I think I got it. Okay. What did you do?"
did it [inaudible 00:37:40] the...Ok. It runs.Oh I didn't do the closing statements. I just did If-L's and return. Oh and you did it like I 
"Yeah, it's working today."
Yeah.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
March 19th.
"I feel like we're almost done, so..."
"Oh, we have to do flow charts."
"Oh, 15."
Did we even push start?
Okay.
Is this not...oop.
"This answer, 1 is saying, um."
I...never.
"On this one? It was saying that I wasn't in the right, like I have to change my...was yours an ENT or a string? My thing is right. Oh."
"Yeah, yeah. Now it's working."
"Okay, uh. What is it? Prompt the user. Like, this is that student code, right?"
Okay.
Yeah.
Sign input to word. Um.
Create met with method to get valid.
Oh no.
There's one right there in front of you.
Yeah.
"Hey, they don't want you to put the code in the student code, right?"
Okay. Okay. So do it- okay. Got it.
"Do I have to do it for each one, or can I get, like where A-E-I-O-U, I can just write--"
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Thank you.
Okay.
How do we do methods in flow charts?
Okay I have first enter the string. Then put it into Word. Can I just put Word there? Or 
do I have to do more?
"Well, like does this- rectangles are like for processes happening so I'm just putting like "
input the secret just Word.
We can't use- what do you mean we can't use that string? What?
What?
Um. What?
It doesn't say that on the back.
Maybe she didn't mean to say that.
"I don't think I'm doing this right, actually. But I think these are the [inaudible 00:54:14] statements."
What did you say?
Yeah.
Hm.
Ha.
"Okay, this is what I got."
I don't know how right it is.
You need me to-
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Yeah.
Today is April 2nd.
Okay.
"Yeah, it copies the references. [crosstalk 01:00:54]"
Copies the reference?
I just looked in the book and it says that is a reference.
In which we use...
I think this one is the first one. Or make a copy of the past array. I think that's what its saying is in the second program too. Question 9.
Hm. Okay. Activity 18.
Begin an array that's [inaudible 01:02:55] user.
Um.
Yes.
"Yeah, okay, sorry."
"You know what else it- no string 9, not 10. It's the same-"
-It's the same ten names because its with the zeta.
Okay.
What is that?
"I didn't- that's right. Names, I equals input.next"
Okay. Um.
"Ah, okay."
Because that does that code basically?
Was there- Why does it matter- It's black just because its not all the way done yet?
Wait. Index is a number.
"Aren't you returning, wait, what is it asking you return?"
"Oh, yeah, nevermind. You wouldn't need it. Nevermind."
"I think you're returning the I, not the index."
What is the point of having the index equal zero.
"No, I'm saying like, why do you have to have that and then make this-"
equal that.
"Couldn't you just return I and not set that to zero, or set it to I."
"No. Just, uh."
I guess that's...
Here?
"I had it written like that, I think if I got that."
Oh why oh why. It got mixed up. Okay. Okay. It works.
Yeah. I need to shut the...
Sorry.
Yes.
