"No, it's anonymous!"
You're a number.
"And 42. Damn. I feel like we got to be closer, this thing is gonna fall off."
"I feel like it's just gonna fall off. Hold on, we can put it back here."
That's true.
But see it's not on the floor.
"Here, we'll put it on this thing, that's perfect. We're good."
[crosstalk 00:01:11] That was a really aggressive and weird week.
"Okay, well, now we have to finish making [inaudible 00:01:24]"
[inaudible 00:01:34] We've got 30 minutes left and they're still passing these things out.
"Just because Sarah didn't come. Start the activity. I mean, hey yeah. Just an idea. Just an idea."
"Damn. Just shoot yourself down. Well, really, I was just saying, ""Man, you just shot your own self down, just put yourself down like that."" Positive self-talk is key now. I haven't been to therapy in a while if you can't tell."
"Oh, damn. I just took it out of my bag, too. I had a whole bottle of ibuprofen, I put in my car."
I asked my manager from Advil from the little first aid kit. He literally gave me four packets. They're all 200mg.
"No, that's not bad. I was like, ""Bro, you really tried to give me this many mg of Advil?"""
"It was fine with me, I might just fall out. Whatever."
"Oh yeah, my sister was prescribed 1200 at one point, for her arthritis."
"Cause my mom was done with the biological stuff, and they were just trying to manage her pain."
Yeah.
"She was eight years old taking that much ibuprofen. That's fucking insane. I mean it's better than the steroids they had her on, though."
I took steroids in 3rd grade for my fucking eyeball.
"I had those and pills, it was fucking insane. I'm pretty sure that's partially why I'm fucked up because the amount of medicines they put me on. This is totally related to what we're doing."
"I feel like there's got to be a different way to do this. Man, why is that shit so large? You forget your glasses today?"
"Well, no, it just-"
It just looks like the old people texts. It was...you know?
There we go.
We can find you a walking stick too if you need it.
Are you having them input this string in the main method?
Okay.
"Oh, and you're just calling the method and the system and the print-line.... Yay."
"I was gonna say, I saw him wear closed-toed shoes one time, I know I've seen one pair."
I think it was raining that day or something.
Really?
That's true. [crosstalk 00:05:59]. But do you only have leather flip-flops? Because wouldn't that turn your feet brown in the rain? That shit aggravated the hell out of me.
That's true.
"I mean, but the bottom of your feet aren't brown. I've never seen a person with actual brown feet on the bottom. I've seen a lot of feet because I used to be a swimmer. Yeah, swimmers are weird."
I did it just to see the feet. That was it.
So I can see the feet!
Oh my God.
Next time I swim I'm not going to stop thinking about feet.
Wow. I learned something new about myself today.
Did you have the method return an int value?
Yay.
"Oh, cause you're doing the upper- and lower-case?"
"Oh, make the whole string lower-case, that makes sense."
What do you need the or for?
"Oh. She was saying something about the ASCII code, though."
"Everything she was saying sounded so complicated, I was like there's got to be an easier way to do it."
That's true.
It tells you on the front page.
She said there's only five vowels. Cause I had the same question.
I have 59.
For what?
Teacher. The teacher said. The teacher.
The she shells.
"Did you put a little...oh, you called it string a. Oh, that fixed it, because it was saying I couldn't use the strings-"
Gotcha. And then you make it all lower-case. Two lower-case.
America.
Color?
Hmm.
"Chug, chug."
Probably! Probably so.
"Do we...oh yeah we make...zero, that's what I thought. And then the conditions are...."
"In the for-loop, you did vowels ++?"
Yeah?
"Cause you're increasing it until the end of the length, right?"
And that's where I need the or thingy.
I found the or thingy. So we're good to go. We're good to go on that.
I-
"I haven't even tried. It's probably not that hard, I could probably do it."
Points!
So did you do vowels ++ if it was one of the vowels?
"It's inside of an if, inside of a for."
"Yeah, that's what it says."
Is it character at i? Is that what you use?
True.
Of course it is.
You have to do a flow-chart for two?
"So did you write this and then do an or, and then write it again?"
And then put it all in a big parentheses?
You don't have to?
"Oh, it's already in the brackets?"
"Oh, so you just-"
And then you did or.
A different...okay.
What the fuck?
"Yeah, that's what I said. I only trust Sarah."
"A, E, I, O, U."
Did you have an else/for too? Or did you just-
Or did you just do the if?
Do you [inaudible 00:28:21]
"For my code it's not getting the upper-case ones, even though I did two lower-case. I don't know why. Cause if I enter ""I am happy,"" whatever, it only counts two. But then if I run it....""My happy"" I don't freaking know, see it counts it right there. Did it do that for you?"
Should we just add all the upper-case ones?
We could do.... [crosstalk 00:30:22].
I really don't like him. I want to smack that gum out of his mouth. It's just so aggravating. [crosstalk 00:30:40] I have a big issue with arrogance. Was that a good or a bad fuck?
Bruce Springsteen.
42. 42!
Okay. [crosstalk 00:54:38]
Too much is going on.
I'm so stressed.
There's too much going on. There is so much going on. Okay.
I cannot...
Oh...
Puns!
"This shit real as fuck, though."
How did we know?
We're all managing.
"I mean, if we need to pull out a list of microaggressions..."
Oh yeah.
You said what?
"Can we do all this in one class, do you think? I don't want more than one class right now."
There's array! Array. Fill the array with random integers.
Find the maximum value of array... value and index...
What?
What's a cry?
Very good.
"There's one problem but there's one, two, three, four, five, six parts in the problem, which was explained, but I couldn't really hear cause there was a lot of shit going on."
So we're only making one array?
"What are we importing? Are we getting scanner import? I mean, cause it says, so you're making... how many elements... oh, so we aren't getting scanner import actually. Aw shit, this is stupid."
So the size of the array is decided by the user?
You are so confusion.
Is it Richard Philosophy?
This is stupid.
"I know, but it's also stupid"
"I know, but it's also stupid."
It's all good.
What the [crosstalk 01:02:14].
User defined size. [crosstalk 01:03:08].
So is the user also naming the fucking [inaudible 01:03:19].
Just giving you the size.
So how do you ...
I guess it's an integer.
Shuffle.
How would you make it the desired size of the ...
A four loop?
You put the users ...
Kind of.
But isn't this right here the actual array?
But how is it calculated in the length if the length is based on the user input?
"So how do you take that, the size and then make it the-"
Yeah. I have that and I have that variable but how would you make that variable the size.
We'll probably do it at home.
Do you put the [inaudible 01:06:50] in the bracket thingy with the [crosstalk 01:06:51].
I have no idea.
No idea.
Do you put the size in the bracket? What? [crosstalk 01:07:31].
I just asked a question. I don't know what's funny. That's the point. It's exclusive.
Yeah that makes it.
What the values are.
"Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay."
Casting. Type casting.
You got to cast it. Mold it.
The random is what? It's a times ...
Times the random.
Plus one right?
"So it's zero to nine. So it's what, nine, 10?"
So the loop is what you do to create the random values for however many they decide. [crosstalk 01:12:20].
Oh man. My microphone should go right here. There we go.
The length. That's just like the control variable right?
That's what that shit's called.
Links. [crosstalk 01:13:18].
Equals random ...
How do you get it to make a different random variable.
It's impossible. Nothing's impossible.
Ron stoppable.
And the naked mole rat.
I don't know. I just remember the song. There was like a whole music video.
I'm going to Google it. Naked mole rat.
Name. Kim Possible.
Rufus.
Rufus. The soul brother of Ron Stoppable. He lives full time in Ron's pocket.
Yeah.
Well it didn't say to print it. It just said to fill it. Then it said to find the maximum-
Calculate the average.
All of them?
Index of that value.
So that is just kind of like the index. Don't forget your shit's touch screen.
Is it saving it into the array?
That's how we call it whenever we wanted ... we just type it with the brackets if we were going to call the array I guess is that what you call it?
Calling it. [crosstalk 01:16:03]. So random.
We also have to print out the index?
The value of the highest number.
I'm just curious.
There's a whole array of method API whatever mabobber in this.
"Because there was one that was like, you can have it copy array or array dot copy or some shit like that."
So there's ...
Which we'll be finding the largest.
The max is ... [crosstalk 01:17:27].
Why doesn't it start at one though for the max? What if the value at zero index is [crosstalk 01:17:51] value.
I don't know. It says that shit is double.
see if you do a type cast or some shit if that changes it.
Oh it could find it array.
Fucking rude. Rude. [crosstalk 01:19:18].
So it's a four loop with an if condition.
Should we put the print line right in the four loop or outside of it?
The print line? Like to print the max? Would you put it in the four loop or after the four loop?
"Every four loop, yeah. [crosstalk 01:21:33]."
you have to print the index.
That's what I was trying to figure out. That's going to return what the value [inaudible 01:22:53] index is right? So we have to somehow ...
That's what you feel like you look like. That's what you say you look like?
Oh my God.
Yeah. Mine won't run.
I don't know what's wrong with it.
It's saying there's something wrong with my if statement.
I don't know what's wrong with mine though.
"[crosstalk 01:29:47] I don't know, when I run it it keeps making this thing. It's highlighting this every time I run it. I don't know what's wrong with it."
Index 40.
Which one is what?
I mean the random.
Which one?
What line?
"This line, if. Four."
Oh that should be index. Ah damn. What the fuck. So the random is what you said is not working.
Because it's just zero. You had to put it in parenthesis?
I mean that could be correct but I don't know. [crosstalk 01:31:30].
That's really weird. I reel like it's got something to do with the loop it's going through to find the max. Is that what yours is doing?
Yeah what's wrong with it? I didn't even touch it. Oh I did. I wrote 30 right here. On a random line. What the fuck. How'd I even do that. [crosstalk 01:32:14]. So ...
Index is one. Index is less than the length of the array.
It's saying the max is always the last value.
Yeah that's what we're doing.
...and then see?
Would you just put that in the four loop-
...where you're doing the random numbers so it prints it all out?
I guess that's how we find out. How are you having it printed?
Did it not print it at all?
"A, a, a ..."
So that it's doing that every time.
It's not for every ...
"Okay, because that's what I was asking when I said, ""How do you get it to put the random value into the room, and then do another ..."" Okay. Okie dokie."
Do you just do-
"Oh, keep it?"
You just declare and initialize random in that [crosstalk 01:35:22]
Down there.
[crosstalk 01:35:37] Did it still not work? It kind of worked. It worked [crosstalk 01:35:44]
Shit.
Ridiculous.
"Wait, but seven's not even on this thing. It didn't even print out a seven, though."
It's not printing.
"Oh, zero, one, two, three. That'd be four still, though, if you did zero, one, two, three. That's still four, and my index is five."
It goes from zero to four.
"Oh, the first one on this?"
In the loop?
"Oh, damn."
Because it starts the index with one?
No Ls. [crosstalk 01:38:23]
"Okay. But it's not an index five, so it's getting the index wrong."
"Because it's saving the index every time it runs and checks it, so at the end of the loop, it's going to be the end of the ..."
But how do we get it to store the index value-
"...where the max is found? We should do it in the If statement. Wouldn't we? Because once it's gone through the If statement, it's already met the condition that it's at max. Right?"
"Yeah, because this here is saying that index, whatever's here, is going to return the right one. If this index value was five, it wouldn't return."
"That's done in the four loop, checking them. But once it meets that condition, it goes to the If where max is saved as that value at that index. Right? Somehow, if we extracted the index in that If [crosstalk 01:40:39] it would be right. Right? I'm guessing it has to be."
That's the only thing I can think of.
Max index. I'm thinking here.
"One. Oh, top."
Did it not work?
You'd have to have [crosstalk 01:41:52] in the loop?
"It's still wrong, I think. Yeah."
It keeps eight. That's definitely wrong.
"Look, I had some kind of intelligence to offer."
Look at that.
"Okay, there's index two."
That is true. That's a double L.
Double L.
"Man, that took too long."
"...thing. Now, calculate the average …"
Calculate the average of all [crosstalk 01:44:33]
Charlie could be a girl.
I've met a couple of Charlies that were girls.
I have.
I have.
Fucking [crosstalk 01:45:12]
How do you do that? You'd have to take the value of the array index.
"We'd have to do that in the loop, wouldn't we?"
"It's definitely going to be a loop. It would have to start at index zero, right? [crosstalk 01:45:37]"
That would be the size given by-
What?
"Why? It's so annoying. It happens so often, too."
"I don't know what happened, but I think whatever holds it in place ... When you go just a little bit too far, that shit just falls."
"[crosstalk 01:47:56] that a zero, right?"
"Should you declare it outside of the loop, though? Or are you going to have it print in the loop?"
...average.
I got you.
Integers.
[crosstalk 01:48:50] sum.
Why did I put an O as a zero? What the fuck?
It's [crosstalk 01:49:21] outside.
You just going to print the print line. You really like saving time. Efficiency is your thing. That's funny.
I have a feeling that it's ...
"Okay, I think it worked for me."
It worked for me. What was it saying [crosstalk 01:52:08]
Brackets.
I think we're about to be on [crosstalk 01:52:28]
I don't drink that much. I used to.
That's it?
C.
I'm pretty sure it worked for me.
Oh.
You got D?
Find the elements that have higher values than average value.
Copy them into a new array named High Values. What the fuck? [crosstalk 01:53:32]
The first array we made was supposed to be called Source.
It says it in the thing. I didn't realize.
"It says, ""Create an array of integers with user-defined size, and name it Source."" Then down here it says-"
I didn't understand that.
"Then it says, in part D, ""For this, you need to create a new array with the same type and size of the Source array and name it High Value."""
Mine worked.
Got it. Now we have to do that shit.
I feel like part E won't be too hard.
"Bro, I'm just saying. I'm giving you a little bit of light."
"I'm trying to look, make sure there's still some sort of light."
Once we get through D we're halfway.
[crosstalk 01:54:59] approach D.
"If only. We've got to do D still, so let's do that."
I've had to do that. I started doing that for my brackets because I don't know ...
That'd be hilarious. How many loops did you use for the part D? Just one?
"D, the High Value shit."
Three loops just to do that?
Sounds about right.
That saves the values or something?
...new array
They want us to print the new array?
But it says it has to have the same type and size
"That's what I'm saying. It says, ""You have to create a new array with the same type and size of Source array, and name it High Value."""
"Oh, they don't have to be?"
"Oh. Well, it seems kind of stupid to make an array with a size larger than you know you'll need."
"That's true, but you can use garages for other shit. Array's you can only use to store shit."
"Yeah, but you can make it into a room or all kinds of things."
People do that all the time. You can't repurpose an array.
Sure.
I don't know if I want to get that far.
Okay.
[crosstalk 01:58:10] I've had collections call people at work.
It's one of the signs.
I do need to start going back to the gym.
Why not?
It's all right. It's not the worst gym I've seen.
We have right here [crosstalk 02:00:20]
It's behind it. Yeah.
That's sweet. That's not bad.
Yeah.
That's why I stayed over here.
They're a thousand for residents?
Because the one I got for commuter was 450 for a year.
It's the same price it was when I lived on campus.
The fuck?
"Yeah, because I haven't had a parking pass for the last three years because I lived across the street. But now I live in South Park, so I have to have a parking pass."
UNCA? Damn. How long did you go there?
How was it there? I knew a lot of people that swam on the swim team there.
"Yeah, I don't think I'd like it."
There are a lot of gay people.
I call it the pride community.
I have a problem with the pride community.
Tell me about it.
Try being a really mellow queer and then being with that constantly. It's ...
"How I looked earlier in class, that's how I am, about, every time I'm at Pride."
"At UNCA [crosstalk 02:02:31] It was like, what? 2,000 people there?"
"We have 30,000 undergraduates."
"When they had that Keith Scott Lamont thing, they had a sit in and a union and all that. But they didn't do anything this weekend. There was another guy killed at Burger King on Betty's Ward. They didn't do anything about that one."
That's crazy.
"Right, we're trying to learn."
We're trying to learn. I thought the thing about the Chapel Hill ... What was it? The statue they took down. Silent Sam or something
I don't know.
I think things are going a little too far.
I get how the symbolism could be used.
Offensive.
"Learning that has been the biggest thing that has revolutionized the way I just think, especially politically."
Right.
"You're reddish. Stop going to that social justice place. That's why you [inaudible 02:03:49] I sit there, and I'm just like, ""Do y'all not hear what you're saying?"""
"They pissed me off so much on Tuesday at work, I went from being available five-"
"It pissed me off so much on Tuesday at work. I went from being available five days, to two and a half."
"Yeah, there is history they have."
Yeah.
"Well, did you hear about ... there was some campus up north, I don't remember where it was. But they're literally giving reparations to students who are black."
"Because the school owned some hundred slaves, or some shit, and then they sold them. And they're like, revelations of the-"
[crosstalk 02:04:47] I think it's supposed to be people of descendants of-
"[crosstalk 02:04:53] I guess it kind of makes sense, but it was being paid for by the students."
Yeah.
Right.
"[crosstalk 02:05:12] That's where I took problem with it. 'cause I was like, ""You're charging a tuition, or a yearly fee."""
Right.
"What did I do? And it's because they sold their slaves, that they're all ... I'm like, ""What?"""
Where did that money go? I don't know. It's just confusing and weird.
And people are handing out-
People are handing out-
That's true.
If we have one.
Time's not real. (laughing).
"He's not in our lab, is he? I didn't think so."
I don't friggin' know.
He said he used three. I don't think we need three.
"Well, 'cause you said he had one counting them, to count the index you're at. And then one that stored those values if they were higher into the new array. And then he used another loop to print the new array, but I wouldn't use them. I would just print it in the one where you're storing the new array."
So basically-
"I don't either. So I think you have to have one counting the index, and comparing the value at that index, to the value of the average. And then, maybe use an ""if"" statement, to put it into the array."
"'cause if it is greater than this, then save it to that."
So you would have to do ...
Pretty much. But would you do ... You would still do ...
"Yeah, you would start at zero, and you would still do the length of the array, because you wanna get all of 'em."
"Array one. Man, Cookout got those little cheeseball things now. You know, like what Culver's has? The little fried cheese curds."
Cookout has those shits now. It's over.
I don't need it either. I really don't need it. But I eat that shit.
"Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. I really only get it ... I got it today, 'cause they pissed me off in that thing. Well they just pissed me off, 'cause we had a little white and black people group things about race."
"And I was just like, I don't know, that shit aggravates me. Like, y'all really wanna talk about race, but then you separate us by race."
To talk about race. The fuck? Whatever.
I plus plus.
I ... is ... greater ... than ...
You have to somehow ...
"It's called High Values. Underscore, High Values."
"Do you just declare it, and not initialize it?"
You have to initialize it?
"'cause you have to ... You can't do that, right?"
'cause you're still doing the same size.
"So then, we store it into High Values."
But how do we make it ...?
Yeah.
And then we do ... shit.
"It'll be high values, right? I ..."
Okay.
"Now every index that's higher than, it'll save it at that index."
Will be equal to nine.
And the same thing for-
Two.
Two.
He really used three loops for this.
No wonder he used loops. Why's he always using loops?
"What's his name, by the way? I just know him as, he goes by The Scalawag."
Chase.
"The nicotine guy, I don't know his name. I know Toby."
"All I know is, he likes nicotine."
And I feel like we're too far into the semester to-
(laughing).
I'm not trying to be like that. I could always go look on the team member things.
I would never have guessed that for his name.
"Actually, I might [crosstalk 02:13:27]."
"Oh, that's the guy that you buy the vape stuff from."
"So, his name's Isaiah."
"I would've picked something else, like Daniel."
He looks like a Daniel. (laughing).
Do you have a reason why?
Oh.
But wouldn't you do it after High Values? After the [crosstalk 02:14:16] loop?
I don't know if it makes a difference.
It'll print it.
"Oh, okay."
Chic.
Well it will turn zero and the other values that are not ...
He used three.
It's nested. One nested.
"We used one nested loop, so there we go."
There we go. [crosstalk 02:15:52]
Right.
"[inaudible 02:16:07] eventually, with separating them. I just fuckin' had this [crosstalk 02:16:10]."
That's true.
Through all this shit.
What?
"Yeah, he did."
So ...
"We'd have to do a ""replace."" Could we use a ""replace"" method?"
"Ooh, random shuffle."
"Yeah, I'm trying to."
"So basically, you're making a new list, and ..."
Zero and ...
"Oh, yeah."
It decreases. And then ...
That's ... okay. I see that.
Yeah.
"So is temp an actual label, or just ...?"
"Oh, okay."
You can't just put it nowhere.
Right.
And then it's I is greater than zero.
Right. The random control variable letters don't work for me.
"Oh, 'cause you have to typecast the double."
You can do that.
42
"It is false. Oh, so there's like, a full quiz."
(yawning).
None. And then none ...
But after the method called B A [crosstalk 02:35:15].
What about all the differences between variables objects and how they're similar? [crosstalk 02:35:43].
I don't know.
"I mean that's what happened in an assignment we did last week. 'Cause we had a return ... we had to split it and put the first half, and the last half ... but it wasn't the initial one, it was the saved one. So that makes sense. [crosstalk 02:37:01]."
Charging time.
You feel like you're in a bowl of spaghetti?
"Yeah, everything like-"
Just a tad.
Or an A.
By that. [crosstalk 02:42:07].
That works.
Word.
True. [crosstalk 02:43:13].
I guess so.
Reese's Pieces.
"No. [crosstalk 02:46:20]. Let me get one of the watermelon ones. Watermelon. There's a watermelon one. The green apple, if you ever do the-"
"'Cause there used to be like Jolly Rancher Jell-O. Then I would mix it with the Smirnoff green apple, that shit didn't even taste like alcohol. It was so dangerous."
I think you may have.
"I don't like it, it hurts my face. I have not. Don't. Did you see the green fairy."
Oh the green is stolen.
Absinthe.
Absinthe?
You never drink to have fun?
Or you don't drink?
I like some. I'm a big fan of ciders.
I love ciders.
I had two 16 ounce ciders last night. And I have [crosstalk 02:48:45]-
Oh that. The only one I don't have is question one.
Reference and same.
Well shit.
What kind of plants do you extract it from?
Like tinctures?
So like for the CBD of it? [crosstalk 02:50:21]
Duh.
She's just that board.
Yeah.
Even if you put turpines in it you think? [crosstalk 02:50:50]. Yeah.
What kind do you use for that?
What's the one ... there's one that my [crosstalk 02:51:10].
"[inaudible 02:51:10] I can't remember the name of this one 'cause my therapist she's, fuck. What are all ... I forgot what any of this shit is called."
What is that shit called?
I'm trying to think what this thing is my therapist does. [crosstalk 02:52:07].
"Probably not. [crosstalk 02:53:15]. Shit, what is this shit called? I'm trying to think-"
Yeah. [crosstalk 02:53:32].
It's very strong.
True.
About what? What is the question? [crosstalk 02:55:33]. What is what?
Buddhism?
Booty-ism.
"Um, on Buddhism."
I don't know they focus a lot around suffering. I've watched documentaries.
That material things and-
"Like envy and jealousy, like all those things ... and human existence is suffering. So like they're basically trying to live like ... isn't buddhism the one with the middle path shit? So they're trying to live the middle path to like ... you know, minimize suffering I guess. I don't know."
What's Buddhism?
On the application [inaudible 02:56:53] you just put max.
"Yeah, that's a weird one. I was wondering 'cause Max isn't my legal name, so they might not [crosstalk 02:57:05] they'll know who I am. Yeah, they should know who that is ... you're talking about. Jerry will know. [crosstalk 02:57:18]. Gerald's the GM over there. Yeah. Gerald will know who Max is. He was so mad when he lost me, but he did it to him self. So fuck it."
"I don't know if it's changed. The last time I talked to Jamie, which was the only manager I liked over there, she told me it was getting better but I know she just left 'cause she got a promotion. But the GM, 'cause I was working at the white hall one, so some guy named Dan-"
"His wife is training to come to UNCC for managing. I don't know anything about her, but I heard she's nice. I guess. I mean Gerald not mean, he's just lazy. I guess it's alright depending on what position you're doing. What'd you apply for?"
Dude 22.
I didn't even read this assignment.
Is there only one thing?
So it's a name search. [crosstalk 02:58:49].
Booty-ism.
That's actually Hinduism. [crosstalk 02:59:10]. Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Yoga. Pretty sure Yoga started with Hindus.
I said I'm pretty sure Yoga started with the Hindus.
Yeah.
"No, I said yoga."
Yoga is from Hindu.
Came from where?
Well yoga's a type of martial arts technically.
I didn't.
Wait.
We have our recorders on.
Unless you want us to stay and be captive? Do you wanna stay and be captive Richard?

I feel like a-
Weirdo.
Right.
Search. Whoa. [crosstalk 00:00:53]
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure-"
Oh no.
It's a lot of work. [crosstalk 00:02:08]
This page with a cat and a coffee says a sequential search. But I don't know.
I have no idea.
Or just search.
Searching.
Searching is what we're going with?
Linear.
What would we return to our [inaudible 00:03:04]?
I think we just went with searching.
Really?
"Well, it's going to be searching."
Search is the process? Searching.
"True. Oh, it's one? Okay, let's say..."
"It would be the negative one, right?"
Did y'all get six for six?
Three?
"Oh, true."
Oh that's supposed to be a selection sort. That's what she was talking about earlier.
What's on the board.
I saw that and I just scrolled back up just to look at it. I didn't want to.
Why did you get the answer above? What the fuck?
Oh.
Hey.
Group think.
Eight?
I thought eight was-
One.
For trick question eight.
Where are we going?
I just have cartridges.
"Well, I have a little piece, but I don't have anything to put it in."
I'll teach you.
"What if you want to have options, you know? Versatility is the name of the game. Keeping that tolerance."
Yeah.
"That's crazy because there's a poll someone did and it was like 60% of smokers don't know how to roll. I was like, no [crosstalk 00:10:04] got to start rolling everything. Like, what the fuck?"
"I didn't even think about that. My friend Joseph, the same one that's still waiting on his shit. I taught him how to roll for his 20th birthday so I wouldn't have to roll anymore. Technically it was a birthday present to me, but now he has a skill."
"I was like, you have a skill. I'm giving you wisdom for your birthday."
How to roll a blunt.
"I sat, I taught him. He got it on the first try, though."
Taught him the whole thing.
Easier for me. And we didn't waste nothing. It was great. Continuing the tradition. What my plugs taught me.
"Yep. I'm going to teach my children. No, I'm kidding."
True.
"Oh yeah, that's what my boyfriend said."
That was me like-
"They're very discriminatory on that, yeah."
Kill you on sight. I don't know about that.
I think-
So I think it's...
So it starts with the mid being four?
That's basically like filling out a table. Okay.
"So what she was doing earlier on the board? Where she was going through it, saying, so we're pretty much doing that?"
"But I'm pretty sure mid starts with four? And it's [crosstalk 00:12:37]. Ah, shit. I just..."
There were no names.
Just our inmate numbers.
42
Yeah.
I'm 42.
Jim Bob Billy Bob.
Oh my God.
"What's the right answer, is the question?"
"I don't care if it's technically right, I just want to get the grade. I was on Rate My Professor trying to pick professors for next semester. There's like two people with decent reviews in the computer science department. The fuck?"
"Oh, obviously."
I don't know anything.
Time?
"I started, but I registered for two classes and I don't know what else to fucking register for."
I should do them over the summer. That way I could open up for Fall. I don't want to do that shit. [crosstalk 00:14:41]
Where did you even get that? I have never seen a package like that. This is like that.
Where'd you get that?
"Oh. Why don't they sell those in stores? Because I don't want to buy the king size, I don't want just two. So then I always just end up buying the king size anyways."
I don't fucking get what they're talking about.
"Oh. So we have to, we're putting it through this method."
This is fucking stupid.
Honda Civic?
"What? Yeah, I've seen those. That's where that's from?"
Oh my God.
Burritos.
Try again tomorrow?
I think we could do it.
"I think we just... five, four. [crosstalk 00:16:59]"
What's 10?
"It's just, we have to fill out a table. We haven't done it."
I just don't want to keep going up to this thing.
"I'm good. Thank you, though. I appreciate it. It's got my blue ball over here. Blue ball."
I think so.
It's a great number.
"You can get some cool-ass tattoos on Friday the 13th, too."
Yeah.
"Oh, true. True. I didn't watch it a lot. I've seen like here and there."
"What I saw was always great. I know if I started watching it, I would get fucking... Right."
That's why I won't even any Netflix right now because I can't. [crosstalk 00:18:41]
Bubble sort. Who came up with that name? Why is it called bubble sort?
Oh so it's just-
Group search sounds better. [crosstalk 00:19:01]
Oh shit.
There we go.
I think we said binary.
Yeah. You can do this test three times.
At least tell you it's wrong.
"Well, at least tell you what you got wrong."
"No, that's..."
What are we learning anyway?
What does it say? [crosstalk 00:21:23]
"I'm pretty sure it takes the smallest ones, which is, doesn't it? [crosstalk 00:21:29]"
The first?
Well what if the first is the smallest?
Then it's finite? All right.
[crosstalk 00:21:56] in multiple phases.
We pass successfully [crosstalk 00:22:01].
"Man, I totally, totally forgot."
"Well, I guess she's getting what she wants, then."
"That's the kind of material she needs, though."
"Whoa, that would be the best way to get material, though."
With college students. [crosstalk 00:22:37] Oh my God. That's actually a brilliant idea.
Fake data. [crosstalk 00:22:56]
Bubblesaur?
True.
Oh my God.
True.
I was definitely questioned.
Still questioned. I'm 24. [crosstalk 00:24:11]
Well-
It would be so confusing.
"Yeah, probably. [crosstalk 00:25:37]"
I guess it's-
That's selection sort. [crosstalk 00:25:55]
That's what she was talking about.
Selection sort. So now we just have the tables things to fill out. [crosstalk 00:26:00]
I just don't want to keep going up and looking at that stupid thing.
"You said, yeah. Well, you said binary and then linear?"
They told me the other way around.
Since this was... [crosstalk 00:26:54]
Negative one.
What you'd put for number seven?
"Binary. [crosstalk 00:27:22] okay, so it starts mystery method all the way up here. [crosstalk 00:27:31] Oh, hi. [crosstalk 00:27:31]"
[inaudible 00:28:07] [crosstalk 00:28:07]
Oh shit.
Is it right?
"Yeah, that's what we put."
"It was negative one, right?"
True.
So then nine is what? [crosstalk 00:30:37]
Four was one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bulbasaurus.
What does that-
Bulbasaur? What is...
I didn't really get into Pokemon.
"Should've. Everyone was into Yu Gi Oh at my school, though."
Yu Gi Oh was so good.
It was so big. [crosstalk 00:31:47]
These are all the same?
Are those rows or columns? Rows?
"What the fuck was three, I heard 3, 2, 5, 8, 3, 2, 5, 8-"
They do.
Oh they're all three...
They're all thin?
"2, 3, 5, 8."
Did anyone attempt 10? Because I started 10 and then I got mad. [crosstalk 00:34:19]
Hive is two.
Six. [crosstalk 00:35:24]
True.
Oh we have to actually put the spaces in there and shit.
You should have withdrawn when you still could have.
Oh. [crosstalk 00:37:24] Right. [crosstalk 00:37:24] Trash. [crosstalk 00:37:24]
Damn. [crosstalk 00:37:59] I don't even remember what he looks like. I haven't seen him in a while.
"Well, six wasn't in it, so..."
[inaudible 00:38:15] Value I. So... [crosstalk 00:38:23] Record the current order of the sorted array of... [crosstalk 00:38:31]
Current big curve.
The index in J. [crosstalk 00:38:45]
So we're just showing the iterations they'll be in until they're fully sorted.
Five. Three. [crosstalk 00:39:15]
It's proven.
"Oh no, he's up front. [crosstalk 00:39:51]"
Right. Normally he just vapes in here anyways. [crosstalk 00:39:58]
So five should be [inaudible 00:40:24]. [crosstalk 00:40:24]
Just a little bit.
"Well, so we got 2, 3... 5, 6, 7, 8, 9."
[inaudible 00:41:15]
42
I was going to ask because she just said that it's supposed to be filled with user input numbers so. 
But here it says to fill it with random integer numbers. 
Okay. 
But is the ... Because it says the dimensions are random and to fill it with random. So do that? 
And still use the random number to generate what's being inputted into the area? 
Okay. 
For the filling it's one and nine. 
Okay. Thank you. 
I don't even know what she said. 
Data type. All right. 
This one's only like one activity but there's a few parts to it. 
"Oh, you started it? "
Yeah. Yeah. How'd you start it though because it wasn't open. What ... I'm confused. 
Was it? For like a second. Damn. 
"I don't care about that class that much. I worked my ass off, too this week. "
Time. 
Yeah. What? The place? 
"Heck, yeah. "
"To make it start the random number at a certain one that's when we have to do the plus, right? "
The times and then the plus. 
Plus one. 
Yeah. It's like a coordinate point on like an XY plane. 
Calculate the average. 
"No, we can't. We're doing 212 and 213. What you talking about? "
I know. 
I'm trying to decide if I'm going to take summer classes or not. 
"Oh, yeah. I've honestly been considering transferring. "
What do they mean by maximum average? 
It's in the book. 
It's fun. Just keep clicking it and it looks like a bunch of different weird ass shapes. 
You said next. Does it have another index? 
So you get an infinite array. 
Why would we want that? 
What would we use it for? What could it be used for? 
That's the most practical use for it right there. That's all we need it for. 
I've been listening to a lot of rock recently. 
You've got to. You either have to have the rock or the EDM on for lifting. 
True. True. 
I definitely use that song for some workouts. 
Bullshit. 
It's generated randomly. 
It's for both. It's for both. 
"Oh, I did it wrong. Shit. I just did the random integer wrong. That's an easy fix because for the dimensions it's two to nine. "
It worked. Look how small that one is. 
That's the smallest [inaudible 00:18:29] I've seen it make. It's four.
I love it. Go random. All right. 
They might get here by the end of class. 
"Oh, shit. "
So it's for each column. 
Okay. That makes sense. I found the average of the entire array. 
It doesn't say. 
No. No. No. The average of the-
You ordered food. 
"Oh. No, because you can literally get like 7-Eleven or Walmart and whatever. You can get all that shit delivered. "
Right. Then that's a problem. 
Is it the same driver? 
They haven't gotten a driver yet. 
"Oh, shit. "
Yeah. With the nested four loop. 
You said what? I'm sorry. 
"Oh, because you were waiting on it. "
"Yeah. That's some bullshit. There's more than three columns. Oh, no there's not. There's four. I was thinking rows. "
I was like column and row got flipped in my heard. 
"No, that's just the sum but then all you have to do is divide the sums. "
But that has to be in there. 
I don't know. 
Yeah. 
Okay. I think this is right for the average but now how to compare the averages because this is just-
Yeah. 
But do they want us to save each column into an individual one? 
Yeah. 
Wait. The total sum of the averages or the whole array? 
This is what I have for the average of each column but I have it just with a running total for each column. 
You're getting your chicken wings.
"Oh, is it? Oh, shit. "
It's the same thing. 
Yeah. You want to print it outside of the loop? 
Yeah. 
Separately. Yeah. 
Yeah. The averages are right. This is the first run. 
It's a little smaller. It's just big numbers though. Give me smaller numbers. Okay. We can work with this. 
"Nine, 11, 17, 25, 31. "
"Oh, that is wrong. "
That is definitely wrong I guess because the total is double. 
"That shit's straight from the book, too. "
Maybe Michael's more trustworthy. 
Who knows. 
"Well, let's see if-"
So let's see. Nine plus six. 
Eight plus-
Okay. So this is how you can get the sum. 
I don't understand how it's not printing this out every time. 
It doesn't make sense. 
Okay. Okay. 
"Whoa. Oh, shit. "
Did you hear that? I didn't realize it was that loud. 
"Oh, yeah, a lot of Postmates people just have like people in their car because I used to do that. "
And I figured out what was wrong with the average. I was dividing by the number. I got the rows and columns mixed up again. So now what I'm trying to do is fill in the array in the loop and then print the array out after the loop. 
"I kind of forgot, how do you fill in an array in a loop? "
Okay. My brain is like ... I'm thinking very hard. 
Five million times. 
No. I'm retyping this line. Damn it. There we go. 
Check this one easily. 
Seven point five. 
Yeah. 
Because this is not a normal class. 
The umbrella. 
So how did he do it? 
So it looks like he didn't ... Instead of saving the running total to a temporary variable he just put it into the array. 
That's a smart idea. So he just made an array of the sums. 
What do you mean? 
Where is it saying it's out of bounds though? 
So average. 
We do. 
Sara is. 
From my understanding it's just comparing them and finding the max one. 
Which average is the highest. 
"Yeah. See, it says the maximum average value is on the example. "
"I think I got mine to work for the average shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. "
I just gave up trying to print mine like that. 
We do. 

Twelve. [crosstalk 00:00:11]
Were we supposed to say our numbers?
Oh. I'm 42.
"Sorry, I'm over here trying to clear a fucking space. [crosstalk 00:00:44]"
Yeet?
Mine probably is [inaudible 00:03:24].
It's so versatile. [crosstalk 00:03:27] ...
"Any fucking situation, fucking [inaudible 00:03:40] words."
There's emphasis.
I'm free all the time every day. 
You know what would be more fun? [inaudible 00:05:26] Latinos [inaudible 00:05:26] drinking out of it?
"If anything, I'll just bring in [crosstalk 00:06:17] and just play that in the back."
"Well, I mean, I've got to [crosstalk 00:06:23] ..."
"Yes. Actually, yes. [inaudible 00:06:40] ..."
I'm off on Friday. 
You always work on Friday. 
"Yeah, Friday mornings, that's why I said you work on Friday."
It took three weeks that we [crosstalk 00:08:27] ... 
"We're going to try to get Jeff to come, but, we'll see. "
"He seems like a Christian man, but ..."
In the alcohol [inaudible 00:09:34].
How [crosstalk 00:09:40]?
"Take a picture of what? Oh, that?"
"[crosstalk 00:09:49] okay, [crosstalk 00:09:49] ... "
"No, we're just doing this. "
"Yeah, yeah that's it."
That's all you need.
That is a hard working cell.
Just ... [crosstalk 00:14:03] powerhouse [crosstalk 00:14:07] ... 
That's how the other cells died. They [crosstalk 00:14:18] ... 
You've got a major lemon?
Why?
[crosstalk 00:17:37] no lazy like the rest of us. 
I've seen the peaches. 
"Damn, those are janky. "
I appreciate your generosity.
"[crosstalk 00:18:37] send me the address, I'm walking [crosstalk 00:18:40]."
I did this without realizing it.
[crosstalk 00:24:31] ...
Why not just make five arrays ... And then ... 
I could just make five arrays.
It just shows 'Press enter'. 
It's almost like [crosstalk 00:29:45] all the way down.
What do you mean?
"It puts the one array into place, and says, 'press enter'."
"Yes, show me what I did wrong, because Chris won't. "
What?
Because they're smarter than us.
That's why I said us. 
Smart than me and us. 
"Yeah, but now I have to do it to the point where it checks to see if it lines up correctly, either you win or you don't win. "
[crosstalk 00:31:55] ... 
"So I messed up the first time, and hit enter [crosstalk 00:32:12] ... "
[crosstalk 00:32:25] good fucking [crosstalk 00:32:25] ... 
"Bang, bang, bang. "
I feel positive about our new [inaudible 00:32:58] simulator.
"No one does, Speaker 111, tough it out. "
Should I be putting the code into discord now?
"We did have six arrays without meaning to, I was just trying to get one to work. "
[crosstalk 00:35:51] has to listen to all this stuff. 
"Number 22 was vulgar. Creative, but vulgar. Creative and vulgar. And a complete dumb ass because he's miced up and he forgets his miced up. "
"Miced up and he goes, ""[crosstalk 00:36:12] ... """
[crosstalk 00:36:19] ... 
"[crosstalk 00:38:38] changing colors [crosstalk 00:38:38], it's so right for me, it's just colors everywhere. "
[crosstalk 00:38:41] colors. 
"It's so dull, I can't [crosstalk 00:38:50] it. Thank you."
"No, there is a better way, because I had it to the point where it was showing me a bunch of different color formats you could change [inaudible 00:39:33]."
And then [crosstalk 00:39:34] ... 
Because I had to erase all of this because of [crosstalk 00:39:44] ...
[crosstalk 00:39:47] painful having to go back through the video to make sure I did it right. It was awful. 
You son of a column. 
Watch your fucking mouth. 
"This was two weeks ago, the lab part four."
"Oh dude, I save them all, I just [crosstalk 00:41:03] ... "
