"Today is March, 19th 4748. I got it."
"Sick, lit. I guess just ..."
I just clipped it onto the little thing.
Here.
Okay.
FBI man.
It be like that sometimes.
That is weird. That is a fat weird.
Let me see.
Oh.
You understand this? You understand this? 
Same.
Yes. What you want?
I'm just gonna try to do all these individually because I think that's what the problem is.
"Yeah, well I'm probably doing it a really dumb way but I think it's gonna work."
Hmm?
Don't use a return a statement.
"Okay. Here, I did that for a few of these. Okay. So, when you're doing this, when yore doing a public static void, everything is gonna be in here. So, when I went to return choice C, all that there is is just choice C in this-"
Hm mm-hmm (affirmative).
"No, I just printed everything out in this, so that it runs this."
Yeah.
"I kind of consider public static void, like when it's going down here, it's going through like a black hole. And once you get to the end of it, it just stops and that's where-"
Yeah.
Hm mm-hmm (affirmative).
The ones you're carrying over.
I just did one and it was string sentenced. I don't know how it works if you have multiple.
Public static void is?
Let me just finish it.
Set method return.
"No, mine's not working."
It kept on saying it's one when it's not one. What's wrong with yours?
"When you use void, you don't have string in there."
I think that's the problem.
Hmm?
Why not?
It's all the string. It's still can set a string.
Then you can do it with no void and just return it.
I don't know either.
Yeah.
"It wouldn't even let you output that, right?"
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It is?
Uh huh.
"So, if you just put like a slash in there ..."
"Yeah, that one shouldn't be hard."
I don't think that one's gonna be hard.
"Except, I don't understand. You haven't figured out this one yet, right?"
And sub string.
For the second one?
How do you write what?
In the little parentheses at the end of it. In here you'll do string and then taking the string and then-
Yeah.
And the idea.
You're listening to her right now.
Nunya business.
Huh?
"Nah, it's just some girl, fuck you."
"Yeah, Sirrus never cared about what charts [crosstalk 00:28:28]"
It's on Google.
It does.
I'm just doing it sort of right. But-
"I mean, I think that could work too. I think that could work too but-"
Did I do loop?
Yeah.
"Here, look what I did."
"I made looping a [inaudible 00:32:09] and it was true and then when they put in J, it makes looping false. So, while looping is true, it does all of these and as soon as they input J, it makes looping false."
Yeah.
This is what I did for G and F.
Well.
You got to.
You gotta use sentence length to-
Keep the-
You don't?
Yeah that's F.
Where's F?
I just counted how many spaces there were
Okay.
"You probably could've done it for less, that's just how I saw it."
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
"She said we can't use replace, right?"
Okay.
Can we use?
Okay. [crosstalk 00:34:14]
We gotta take this thing off.
Really turn this off or do you turn it on?
Okay.
Are you following this?
[inaudible 00:45:17]a good question we [crosstalk 00:45:18]
[00:45:21] Oh no. Hell no. Hell to the no.
Yeah.
"Shuffling them, I just-"
Okay.
"Yeah, the size."
A space?
Right there?
Duh.
I don't understand what it means 'fill the array?' With [crosstalk 00:48:28]
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Okay.
We don't know what those numbers are yet. So doing A is what fills it with the numbers? We just-
Yeah.
Yeah. That's what though?
You gotta import it too.
Don't ... do you? No?
[00:51:52] I always forget that too after ...
Hm?
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
"So you can set it to where my list is, it has 10 spots, and so my list at 0 is 5.6. so I'm wondering if you can do my list for all of them equals math dot random."
"Well if I just ... well you could do it that way, but we don't know how many-"
"-the user's gonna input it. So, that's-"
I do that all the time.
"Well id don't do it on this computer, but I do it on the, when we did the labs on there."
So.
Okay. Well-
Don't worry about case studies.
Okay.
"So, [crosstalk 00:55:25] I just don't understand how, use num A right there, but its also the user input. I don't-"
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Okay.
Okay.
"Yeah, we gotta find the max."
Mm-hmm (affirmative) there can be multiple of those right? So we can't just do-
Yes I do. Except the rinse bit about your hair for years.
"Um, I have no idea. Cause it doesn't show what the output's supposed to look like, unless that's the output."
Yeah I have no idea what that- [crosstalk 01:01:10]
Hm?
From what?
"For ... yep, well. I don't understand how index of what. What of that?"
"Wouldn't work, would work? Or wouldn't work?"
"I'm sure it doesn't, because I just don't understand how. I feel like it should've worked, but I just don't feel like it's going to. You know? With this?"
Because its gotta ... there's so may possible things. Can you set it as an index of 9? Because there's gonna be so many ... there could be all 9's. So I don't understand-
Basically I just looked in the book and it says finding the largest element. And it showed that. The one [crosstalk 01:03:40]
Yeah.
Oh wait. Finding the smallest index-
What is the smallest index of the largest? What does that mean?
Oh and this does random shuffle.
Oh. Okay.
Except they've got my list as equal to zero.
"You just get rid, yeah. Oh, that says double max."
Okay. Yeah.
Hm?
Well cause its setting max at zero.
Its setting max at-
Arrays at zero. Cause its gonna go all the way up and go the highest until it stops and gets to the-
"Array dot length. Once it gets to the end, it's gonna stop."
"Okay, so its got a double max, that's set at-"
Array A.
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
"Yeah, and so N I is 1, and well I is less than array A's length, and then increment I. And so."
It's uh-
It's gonna be-
"It's gonna, well if you've got it set at array length, it's gonna go through all of the numbers till it gets to the end."
All the random numbers. All the random numbers.
I think so.
Do we need that zero?
Yeah.
I just wanna run this overnight.
Do you know why that's happening? It says index 45 is out of bounds?
It says at 11.
"Do you hear him? He said put math dot random in its own set of parenthesis. Oh, I don't know why I ..."
"Ahhh, okay. That makes sense."
It's still the same error.
And then it's just max equals uh ... array name and then I.
Those brackets. Oh.
Are you talking about those? Or-
"Those are brackets... er, yeah those are called brackets. You use them for arrays. You've never used those in math before?"
Um...
"Okay, so. I'm getting this error. And I think somethings wrong with this line."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
To 45 okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
"Oh, okay."
Okay.
"Are we displaying all of the... do we display A and then display B or do we just, I don't ..."
Okay.
"Yep, thank you."
So did you hear what she did?
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Instead of having it as- [crosstalk 01:14:10]
"Instead of having it as the input, you make the loop and have it go up by one every time-"
So it checks everything.
Yeah.
I just asked about [inaudible 01:14:37]
"Okay well now, now this one doesn't work."
"Same thing as the other one, it's out of bounds. I think I can fix this though."
Size ... [inaudible 01:15:44]
I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick I'll be right back.
[01:20:51] So I just did zero.
"I shocked you, sorry."
Oh shit.
Does it run?
Lets fucking do it then.
Okay. Wait.
"I got that the highest one was 9. Alright. We're gooch. Wait. Here, let me try one more thing."
Oh wait. Yeah.
"Okay, then it inputted an 8 so there's no 9. Goochie."
"Yeah, copy. Oh well, we just ..."
"Wait, I'm trying to ..."
Do we even have to get the index?
"Yeah. I'm gonna do it, sorry. Index of max, okay."
Okay.
"Okay, so its basically the same 4 statement as that one."
"So, right there, right here is the only difference. And so it puts max at my list. And this one, you've got index of max equals zero, and so its index of max equals to I."
"Yeah, basically."
You gotta make an index of X equals zero.
"And index of max, sorry. Equal to zero."
"Wait, your birthday's tomorrow?"
Happy early birthday dude. [crosstalk 01:25:32]
"You don't, I'm an idiot."
no you don't. You don't.
Oh my god. I can't believe they actually made a movie about that.
But its so monetized.
You guys sorry?
I dunno.
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
"Oh, okay."
I didn't do print line.
"Yeah, it works. Oh, is it going infinite?"
I did 99. What did you do?
No bracket on the if statement right there. And you keep that bracket. And now you're good.
"Now, okay. Unresolved, okay, yeah delete that. Now it's fine. Okay. Gucci. No, that's what you want."
That works.
It set the index at 29.
Just make sure you're getting different numbers each time.
And that they're all in the range and everything. I just wanna ...
It just crawls under this dude's car. Watch.
And it just goes right in there.
Australia is fucking crazy.
Oh god.
How do you? I don't understand [crosstalk 01:32:42]
How do you display all of the array at once?
Well how do we know what they are?
How do we do that?
"Yeah, I don't know."
I'll take it tomorrow.
We'll just take it off.
"Hi. If you're listening to this, I can see you."
"They change, did they?"
Okay.
Oh my god.
Did you say your computer's better than his?

"Well, there's still a little bit of daylight outside. How are they going to know that you're saying something?"
"No, they can't."
"No, put it on you like the hoodie, it's going to slide down."
Okay.
Int numbers 13 to [inaudible 00:01:10].
"No, it's question 6."
Oh. 
Why is it asking me the same god damn question as 6? 
"Oh, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it. "
"I don't know what 8 is, I'm sorry. Because you're using the new main, the new method that they put up."
Yeah. It could be 1.
Okay. How many questions is this?
"Does it exist? Yeah, I think it's 1, maybe. We don't have to sort it for binary search, right?"
"No, linear, you didn't have to sort it."
"I don't know, I'm asking you."
"Yeah, you have to sort it."
"Should be, or compile error. Because it doesn't make sense. So it's either negative 1 or compile error. I'm going to go with compile error. Oh no, it's negative 1. No, no, it is, no. I'm confused."
I'm looking at it.
"Wait, okay. Okay, I need to look at this. Do you have a calculator?"
"Okay, so it says mid, right? Mid value? "
"For one? Okay, so mid equals low plus high, divided by 2."
Low plus high divided by 2.
But I don't know what high is.
"What is the length? Count it. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9. There's nine. So the length is 10. Still 9. Okay, so it's still 9. So it would be 9 minus 1, would be 8. "
Okay. Is that option? 
"Oh, okay. You get it?"
"Yeah, put it in Eclipse man, see what happens."
Is it not 4?
Yeah.
"Because I wasn't texting. They didn't kick me out, the program kicked me out."
What?
Childish?
It's every day.
But low is zero. It'd be low plus high.
Yeah.
"Mid, it says mid. Mid variable. So what are you looking at?"
"This, mid variable, right there. "
What the fuck is going on?
Perfect. What is going on here?
"One of y'all can be the group leader to be like, stop this right now, we're going to only talk about coding."
"Yeah, exactly, so stop it. Meet up with them."
What?
For a nap? How long has this been going on.
"What have you learned, Davis?"
Exactly.
I made you do busy work.
9
"Did you find it, Prim?"
The texts.
"Oh, okay. "
"So 6, right? For the first one?"
2
"No, 4, 4. 53."
"Because you're taking the index, right? For 4? And you're trying to find it. So mid is 4, and it's asking what's at 4."
"No, it's 53. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. "
Exactly.
int what?
Where's k?
3.4?
I don't think it'll run to be honest with you. I don't think it'll run.
If you put int numbers and then you put a decimal in there...
Or if you're trying to find a decimal.
"It would go to 4, I think."
"Just int, no arrays. Why?"
"No, it's the first one."
"No, since our key of 6 is smaller than 53."
Yeah.
So it's 5. Is high 5?
Is high 5? For step 4.
"No, key is 6, and then key is less than 53, or 54. "
What are you talking about? Oh. Well what is mid?
"No, no, right here. Mid. Oh, it's 4. It's 3, damn it."
It's 3.
But I thought mid was 3.
Yeah. Is that-
"Yeah, but mid is 4 right? And you do-"
"No, no, I'm not saying that's the answer, I'm just saying mid is 4, right?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"I'm not wrong. She's going to come back and be like, ""It's fine."""
Your gender?
Why?
So you had to take it?
"Oh, because you think it's easy?"
"Yes, but not binary gender."
"Yeah, but it's only going to be on gender."
Okay. I would have done race or poverty.
Uh-huh (affirmative). But why gender?
"Watch, you're going to be writing the same thing all over. There's nothing more to it."
"What, sociology with gender?"
"Okay, you know when you conduct research on sociology, you have to ask them about everything. You have to ask them about race, gender since it's social factors."
Social constructs. 
"So, you can either choose male, female, or other."
"Yeah, so whatever data you're going to have to gather, since every research you have to ask the race and gender, you're going to have to sort it out, why it's and why it's that. It's not going to make any sense. "
"What, are they going to tell you how gender works or something? I don't understand."
"Binary, because it has to be sorted. What are you doing? "
"Oh, you're going to get Mauer."
There is no... stop. Your screen is red.
"Oh, Sarah. For question 10, I just want to know if we're doing this right so far. So mid-"
What?
What? Is that not it?
Is our first one right?
What?
"Oh, okay."
"Oh, okay."
"Okay, okay, okay."
"[crosstalk 00:20:14] No, I did not know. Y'all didn't tell me the information I needed to come to a conclusion, okay?"
Yes we are. We're going to make it [crosstalk 00:20:28].
"Yeah, we're going to run. Can you run? Their might be snakes."
[inaudible 00:20:34] 'cause we studying.
"So, is mid 33?"
"I thought you just do it 1, 2, 3. You start and it's a 0. 1, 2, 3. 33. No, it's 33, because mid is the index, 3. And you start at 0. You start at 0 with the index. How is it 12?"
"So did you do like 1, 2, 3?"
See? You said it right the first time.
So now it's step 6.
"Okay, so what happens if our mid is equal to 6, since it's the same number, like 6 equals 6, what does it do now?"
"Oh, return mid."
"Since it equals to each other, we return 1."
I don't know step 8.
"I don't know, I really don't know."
Yes!
No. 
What'd I say? What'd I say [crosstalk 00:24:02]. You listen to me?
"I got you. So step 1 is 3, because since you were over here yelling at me saying it's an even number and it goes down to a 3, it's 3."
"Yeah, and then you build off of that, and then 33's at 3, index at 3, and then since our key is less than 33, we're going to check the bottom half. What 8?"
"Listen, it's loops. You know how loops are."
Let me see. Okay.
"It's now 1. That came from Maddie, so if we're wrong on that, it's her fault."
"Who? Oh, he's high. Yeah. Look at his eyes."
Okay. 
"It's now 6, and since..."
You don't understand?
"Okay, where do you don't understand? Tell me when to stop this thing."
"Okay, okay, okay."
"Okay, okay. I did that, I did that."
"Okay, okay, okay. Look, look, look. Mid, you see mid? "
"It's going to be low plus high, what's high?"
No. 
"Oh yeah, it's 7, sorry."
So 7 divided by 2.
"So 3, it's going to always go down."
"So 3. Right there. And now it's asking, since mid is 3, the index 3, it's trying to find what is at mid. So what's at index 3?"
"What's at index 3, David? What is it?"
Okay.
"No, I'm done with that."
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Sorry, key is 6."
Okay.
And you said 11 was what?
Math teacher?
"No, did y'all? Did you? Did you?"
Mine was too expensive. Half a page was 50 dollars.
Half a page.
"But still, too expensive!"
"I still want a yearbook though, so I can make fun of it."
For your senior year?
Oh. He wasn't going to make a burn book? I was going to make a burn book.
A burn book.
"Yeah, you don't know what the burn book..."
Yeah.
"So we all agreed that 11 is binary search, right?"
What's it asking. What are y'all looking for.
"Are you sure that's right, Prim? Prim, are you sure that's right?"
Are you sure? Because this says repeatedly.
"Yeah, where it says it."
Are you it's the first one.
Okay.
"Oh, right there. First number. Damn, page 800. I've got to do all this. "
"What page was it again, Prim?"
269? 
800 and what?
Okay.
Multiple neighboring. Huh?
Oh my god.
What sort? What is it?
"No, no, no. It's a... No, no, I don't know."
I don't know.
"I don't think it's selection, because we just did selection and it doesn't look like that."
Maybe.
And selection.
"Awe, this thing again. Is this the last one?"
Damn it.
"Yeah, that's selection. Actually, I don't know, I can't do this. When's this due?"
"So, 8:30?"
It's due at 8:30.
"I just wish they had it like that, I don't want to keep moving it up. "
I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this.
I thought you were just going to let me throw it. 
How do you know the answer.
How do y'all have all the answers?
Are you sure those are the answers?
Was it the group chat?
"Oh, did you ask? You, on the group chat?"
Are you sure?
"No, I mean, are you sure?"
About this?
What...
"I think I got this. Look. Look, I got this, look. "
Fuck you.
I don't know.
Okay.
"Okay, so we're sorting it from least to greatest, so... Actually, I think I might've done it wrong."
Because the indexes are confusing me.
So I don't switch up 7 and 8 just yet?
"No, you didn't. For index 2, you kept it the same as the one before it. Where do you switch it?"
"Okay. Wait, 6?"
You probably have it more right than me.
"Because at 4 you... you switched 6 with 7. Are you going to go get the answer? No, I think you're right, because-"
"Yeah, because at index 4-"
What do you mean? You just replaced it in the order that it needs to be in.
Let me see.
"No, I think you flip it."
"No, if like-"
You betrayed us.
"Oh, what's 7, what's 7?"
I'm sorry.
"That's what we did. 5 is negative 1, right?"
So that's the only ones you got wrong?
"Okay, okay. So I think you swap them. Like, if 6 is greater than 4, it's going to swap those two positions."
"But the i's mean the index, right?"
"So at 3, you switch 6."
"No, it's 7."
Why?
"Oh, I already switched... Okay, hold on, hold on. I did it, that's why."
"So at 3, you switched 8 and 6?"
"7, 9, 8. Okay, at 3. And then 4 would be 2, 3, 5..."
48
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that all that you had to do?
"I printed that. Oh, you had to do two stream."
The exit document?
What survey?
What?
When was this?
"Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I thought it was like... I thought it was like...
No. I didn't know you were talking about the exit form at the end of this class. Yeah. I've been giving you good shit.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did. I promise you."
Um... I don't know.
Why?
"Yeah, I know."
Um... right there. Zero.
It should... you can make that...
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). That's... you do a nested loop. So it does it both. At that random... it says it's one through nine, right?"
I think so.
[crosstalk 00:05:47] numbers between one and nine.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"See, that creates the array. As, like... you know how in one dimensional arrays, we make it new Nth five, and then it'd be five long."
"Well, you wouldn't put new array five dot length: That creates the whole array, and now we're just filling it with... see, right now..."
"It's empty, but it's got all the blocks in it. And now we're just filling it with numbers."
You don't fill it with C.
"Yeah, you fill random numbers in..."
"But you don't do that because it's one through... we fill it with numbers one through nine, not two through nine."
"Uh... I mean, I'm trying it. I'll see if it works, but I don't know. Wait, that's..."
We're doing one through nine. 
Ten plus one?
"Oh, doi. Okay. Why is that not working?"
"Uh... no, 'cause I haven't made it... do I have to make it like a string or something?"
Yeah.
How do you do that?
What is it? Array?
I'm going to ask her.
And just do main array?
Main array plus?
Okay.
Put the space?
I believe you.
Main array M?
C.
Main array...
Yeah.
Assessor.
Yeah.
So this is what I'm getting.
Then you put main array in there?
Would it be on the API?
I see what you're saying.
"So the first two four loops, you've got the numbers for the columns and the rows."
And if we just system out it without a four loop for the...
"No... oh, yeah."
"Wait, it's supposed to be one through nine, and it printed a ten right there."
Mm-hmm (affirmative). That one's one and nine.
Okay. What do you need help with?
Right.
Hm?
Yeah.
"Well, I mean, it works. Let me see if it would work without it."
"Since it's a nested loop, you'd do that."
"Yeah. Equals Nth to the math dot random, times nine plus one. Calculate the average of numbers in each column of the main array..."
I'm creating another... a separate method to get the average.
Yep.
"And then, after the array... after main array, it's brackets."
Yeah. Yeah.
"Uh... four and i, i is less than main array dot length, and then i plus plus, and then just put that out [crosstalk 00:19:27]."
In Cullowhee? There's nothing there.
My friend... my friend used to go there.
There's a strip mall.
"Yeah, no. One of my friends went there. It's..."
The drugs are too easy...
It's a low key bop.
"Yeah, it is. It's a bit..."
The tuition is $500 a year.
Mm-hmm (affirmative). $500.
A year.
Housing.
Because...
Yeah.
"They get money off of housing, basically."
"Hey, Sarah? How do I put a two dimensional array in the parameters?"
I always do dumb stuff.
Thank you.
Is that where you would've gone?
Oh. What was your second choice?
My second choice was Wilmington or App.
I got wait-listed and then I just [inaudible 00:24:01].
"I mean, I probably would've ended up getting rejected, but I'll never know."
You do?
Did you not play a sport?
"I did tennis a little bit, but I wasn't really committed to it. 'Cause we had to play a sport to graduate. Did you? Or did you have to do, like, P.E. or something?"
Okay.
Yeah. That's what I'm doing next year.
Yeah.
"You'll die, dude. What do mean? You're going to die."
There are those people that really thrive living on campus. I'm just not one of them.
"Well, I think first year it's good to stay on campus."
I'm glad I stayed on campus first year.
"Um... I'm trying to figure out how to get the average of all the... just like in part C, that's what I'm trying to figure out."
"No, C."
Oh.
"You gotta put ""i"" on the bracket after... or x. Whatever you did right there."
"No, that's inside. I think you... why is yours scrolling forever? I have no idea..."
"Oh, wait. It stopped. "
I thought it was just...
You forgot to put x plus plus.
Calculate the average of numbers in each column of the known arrays and store them with some variable.
"I tried to take your guys' class, but there was a time conflict with ITSC1213. It was like the Mikhail Gorbachev or something like that?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's been open."
I don't either.
Are you a sophomore? 
'Cause.
"No, but it's going to work either way."
I don't know how to do it.
I don't really know.
Hm?
No. Why do you need super glue?
We get out at 8:15.
I got rid of the whole method.
"No, it's going to be random every time. We're going to... I don't know. It's hard to think this shit through all the way."
Same.
Okay. I think...
I think so.
"Yeah, that's what mine's gonna be like, and I'm only paying $435 a month."
No.
It's University North Terrace or something like that?
I'm sharing it with three of my friends.
It's going to be lit.
It depends on your lease.
How much is our what?
Our what?
"Yeah, I did the math, and like a month, I'm paying around $850 to stay at Lynch."
Yeah. It's almost half that...
Yeah.
I'm getting a bike next year. I'm too poor to afford that.
"No, I'm not going to be on campus."
"Yeah, basically. If I do, isn't there like some..."
"No, I'm going to ride a bike."
I'm going to be that guy riding a bike everywhere.
You don't mind the parking on campus?
"If you're talking about the one in the student union, I don't think so."
I don't pick up super glue.
It's college. Why do you think?
"I'll give it to her. You didn't press anything, right?"
Okay.
"We didn't press anything, I don't think."
48
What'd you say?
"That's where literally all my stuff is. I'm not organized at all. See, if I could pull that up, then I'd show you. "
It's all just in-
"No, no. It's bad. "
You don't? What do you do?
Five four-loop statements? No.
"Oh, wait."
I don't think you need to create five four-loops.
"Yeah. Right here, row is equal to zero, and row is going to be incremented by plus one every single time, unless row is less than or equal to five. It's going to be array row, times the randomly generated column, equals one. It's just going to fill it each time, until it goes through all the rows."
How do I print it? I always forget how to print it.
I don't think so. Actually ...
The moment of truth.
To do the column.
You just need one?
Okay.
"That's right, we don't. Index nine, [crosstalk 00:03:35]."
[crosstalk 00:03:40].
Do eight right there?
"Yeah, same thing."
I don't think that's the problem.
I don't think making it smaller is going to fix it.
It's line 10. Line 11 or 10.
"Well, if it says 11, sometimes the problem in 11 is because of the line before it. I'm not sure why."
I got it.
Got it. Got it.
"I made it less than five, instead of just less than [crosstalk 00:06:19] six."
"Yeah, less than five."
All right.
It doesn't.
How come?
"Row, row, row your boat."
Everything. 
Boom. Look at that. Amazing.
I declared my integers outside of the four loop?
"Sometimes, it does. I don't know what the scenarios are, but sometimes, it-"
"Sometimes, it ... Mine's been perfect every time, or it just doesn't work."
It hasn't fucked up any time since you did that.
"I wouldn't never figured that out, dude."
"Do you know how to do where you press enter, and it runs everything again? I don't know-"
"No, that'll work. I'm just fucking retarded, dude."
"Yeah, I am. "
What the fuck is wrong with this? 
"[crosstalk 00:13:30] press enter, yeah."
Not yet. I'm getting there.
[crosstalk 00:14:18].
"No, I didn't, but I-"
"I went to class without my book bag, signed in, [crosstalk 00:14:29] woke up at 6:50, 7:50-"
6:30
"No, I went to sleep at 6:30. Woke up-"
"AM, in the morning. I was just chilling. Then-"
"Yeah. Then, after that class, I came back and then went to sleep. "
"At, like, 6:15. Then, I took a shower and then came in."
"Yeah. Just, I don't have any [crosstalk 00:15:15]."
"Yes, I have."
"They were long, but they weren't early in the morning."
"It was daytime ... It was, like, 12 to 11."
"I'd just go back home and just do me. Go to sleep at, like, four-"
All I had to do was go to that [crosstalk 00:15:46].
"No. That was my assignment three. I'm just looking at what I have to do with it. I think I fucking got this, though. I think. Don't want to get too cocky, now."
It says it's [crosstalk 00:16:54].
I just had to retype that. It's so weird.
"Yeah. I feel stuck, too."
"If you want money, I guess you do it as [crosstalk 00:20:05]."
"He said, ""Do you know someone rich?"""
I'ma wife that bitch up.
"You got to find a gold digger, dude. You got to find-"
You got to find something to dig gold from.
Get a nice nerdy girl.
Is she a stripper?
[crosstalk 00:21:10].
I'm sure [crosstalk 00:21:19].
[crosstalk 00:21:21] compared to someone [crosstalk 00:21:23] when I was 15.
I don't know if I did. He lives in Myrtle Beach.
Yeah. I don't want to go back.
Yeah. Not ...
I'm waiting for Sarah.
You wanted to be a pharmacist?
"No, it's more than that."
It's definitely more than that. Pharmacy school?
They make a good amount of money.
"It's not just two more years, I promise you it's more."
No way. There'd be so many more pharmacists out there. No way it's two years.
I got you.
What's what called?
They get to travel the world for free.
"My mom wanted to do that, at one point. "
"If she would've done that, I would not be here right now, so probably."
"That's what I'm saying. After a Bachelors, you got to go four more years."
Oh shhhh ...
"Oh, no."
It's not like I'm so going to get a C.
I'm just hoping I stick with the C. That's where I'm at right now.
[crosstalk 00:25:00].
C-A-M-P-F-I-R.
That was high-
"Wait, isn't this one?"
"Yeah, right? I'm going to tell him it's you."
"One of my friends. I want to [crosstalk 00:28:21] so bad, [crosstalk 00:28:22] so bad."
[crosstalk 00:28:29].
He's [crosstalk 00:28:35] just be a tattoo.
"I know, but [crosstalk 00:29:01]."
"Yeah, because if you're [crosstalk 00:29:06]."
He'll always see it backwards [crosstalk 00:29:11].
"Yeah, [crosstalk 00:29:21] look at it backwards. It looks so weird, the first O."
My hand's been [crosstalk 00:29:40].
You do it. I'm trying to ... Have you ran it like ...
Yeah.
"When you do that, yours works, but when I do it ..."
"That's just unfortunate timing, really."
Which was a fucking lie.
Yeah.
"He won, right?"
The Masters.
Golf. 
That's the big golf tournament.
"No, it's THE."
That's my middle name.
"No, Masters."
I think my dad wanted me to be a golfer.
"Yeah. He had all the drug stuff, and then the affair with his wife a few years ago. He's been an underdog, but he came back."
Back problems. I think he just had back problems with that surgery.
"It is, it is."
I think so. Let me see if his works.
