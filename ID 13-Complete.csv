That's good. Does this one open? Ah.,,,
"I know, right? Sorry",,,
"I thought I was weak for a second, I was like, ""Am I that weak where I can't pry this ",,,
"Wait, does yours have this stick?",,,
This is draped over my leg.,,,
"Okay, so, brute force isn't working out at all.",,,
I don't know what else to do with it.,,,
Okay.,,,
Oh,,,
Okay.,,,
Which recording do you guys have?,,,
[crosstalk 00:02:21] get my paper.,,,
My paper fell.,,,
Cause the weight of the cords.,,,
Sorry.,,,
Is Skyler not here? Aight.,,,
Is the first one just a word? Or you can type a paragraph?,,,
"When you said enter the string, it counts the vowels. You got to enter like",,,
Oh.,,,
Yeah.,,,
 Index or contains.,,,
What she's asking for is the code with the numbers including letters? ASCII code?,,,
"She said ASCII code. Is it the...remember, we did a license plate and you looked up the ",,,
code. Is that was ASCII code is?,,,
"In like the method, right? The for loops and the different methods, right?",,,
All right.,,,
Okay.,,,
"Well before, right, though if it was in compiler.",,,
I know.,,,
There's no way it's more than one.,,,
Watch it be six [inaudible 00:19:15],,,
"Oh, you didn't screw it now.",,,
So the ones with periods are methods?,,,
"I only got one, I think.",,,
We'll get them next time. We should feel real next time.,,,
I'm guessing you resorted to guessing.,,,
"We were joking, ""Watch it be five or six.""",,,
"Can you send it? A picture, picture. Can you send it?",,,
Cause my phone's like...will you send screenshot pictures?,,,
"Remember, you were like, ""What is this [inaudible 00:22:09]?""",,,
This sounds really bad already.,,,
"It's cause I highlighted it, I think.",,,
What assignment is this called? What number is this?,,,
It would count it? Plus one?,,,
"I got it, I got it. I think I can handle three.",,,
What activity is this for?,,,
What activity is this? 16?,,,
I [inaudible 00:23:38] for 26.,,,
It would be funny if we sounded similar but they could tell our voices. [inaudible ,,,
Inside...,,,
"Shit. It's in the book, I forgot. It will tell you in the book how to do it.",,,
Why is this so clinky?,,,
I'm trying to do that for loop thing.,,,
What [crosstalk 00:52:27] string you use to find the [crosstalk 00:52:33]?,,,
The thing to find the vowels.,,,
Yeah.,,,
"Yeah, but I just copied the if thing. The other one was the letter [crosstalk 00:53:01]. It ",,,
Why is this wrong? You can't [crosstalk 00:58:01] this?,,,
How do I turn this off?,,,
13,,,
This one doesn't open.,,,
Gotcha.,,,
  This is ..this is asking  report. ,,,
It says prop user enter.,,,
Now you fucked up.,,,
The fudge word?.,,,
Okay.,,,
What? Did that say generating a random number? ,,,
"That's kind of funny honestly. I mean, but we'll add later to it.",,,
Yeah. I have class,,,
5:15?,,,
"Okay. Yeah, I can make it there.",,,
The max.,,,
The max. Getting the max number.,,,
Yeah.,,,
you said we cast it to ten ?,,,
[inaudible 01:26:05]do we cast math.random  and multiply it by 10 you get zero to nine.,,,
Oh my God.,,,
"Hey, can you look in [inaudible 01:26:41] math.random and see if it makes sense?",,,
Oh. Do you have to-,,,
[crosstalk 01:27:00] What if it doesn't work?,,,
"Two, three, four -",,,
"- six, seven, eight, nine, 10.",,,
What.,,,
"It just says zero for me, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, Zzz ...",,,
iDubbbz? The one who does content cops.,,,
"But, can you help me do my Math.random?",,,
"One second, one second, just let me print this out. How, how do you print this out? You ",,,
just print out the source?,,,
[crosstalk 01:28:35] [inaudible 01:28:37].,,,
"Source dot, dot like source uh-",,,
The [crosstalk 01:29:05] had to go onto ... You have to create a for-loop that it's going ,,,
"Yes, yes, that's what I have through this one.",,,
"Why does mine not work? Mine says zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.",,,
You should of just called it source.,,,
Yeah. Fuck. Then everything has to be source.,,,
"I still got ten, though. So it worked the other way.",,,
"Wait, is this a menu you used to do? Or is it just like-",,,
I was just doing it like this.,,,
You don't reference the-,,,
"But there's just zeros on mine. See look, zero, zero, zero, zero.",,,
That's for the max.,,,
Yeah.,,,
They're gonna print out anything. I was just testing the first one and then I was looking ,,,
like ... 'cause I already did almost three so I was like checking to see if it worked.,,,
Can you see the Math.random first?,,,
Where's error in here?,,,
"Seriously, are you Starbucks basic ... spent like five dollars for this much?",,,
Meh. Okay. [crosstalk 01:32:19]. You're excused.,,,
Oh my God.,,,
"Listen, it's on site. Honestly.",,,
I don't want like this much for five dollars. [crosstalk 01:32:29].,,,
What? Where?,,,
This must be ... you changed it to that I ... rest in size.,,,
"Oh, see ... No see, it doesn't compile like that. Like my old way did it.",,,
No.,,,
I was gonna undo it and then fix from Math.random.,,,
I don't know. Let's undo everything.,,,
I was gonna press control z everything.,,,
Still the same?,,,
Oh the period ... maybe it's this one.,,,
My array?,,,
Is my array wrong?,,,
"Just erase it, maybe?",,,
You don't want it to be sideways for this one?,,,
Four.,,,
It's easier to see the recoils.,,,
Oh.,,,
"Like, so here. Could do like-",,,
Cast it to N. And that'll work.,,,
"Oh, okay, so you can just keep this as double.",,,
Or just the Math.random's wrong.,,,
I'm saying it was like that before. That's what I was trying to say. I was doing that for  spaces because I was doing mine sideways.,,,
Oh.,,,
Did he leave?,,,
Me?,,,
"Oh, okay.",,,
"Oh, no. Oh this versions from the book so I-",,,
"Oh, well lets just try it and then-",,,
"ok Oh, I'll change it, I'll change it. yea it really does not matter what we call it",,,
"Okay. I'll just change it. It's no big deal. Yeah, doesn't really matter what this is called ",,,
anyways. [crosstalk 01:38:26]. Where's the problem? Where's the problem in this one?,,,
Where it has an X right there?,,,
Wait what? Why is it [inaudible 01:38:34]? [inaudible 01:38:35] touch his baby. ,,,
[crosstalk 01:38:44].,,,
"Samsung sucks, I'm just kidding.",,,
I'm trying to get back to where it was.,,,
Just chill.,,,
The book.,,,
My second ones wrong.,,,
"Oh, you changed it and now it's wrong.",,,
"You shut the ... I had to do the ... what'd you change, my source? Source.length.",,,
I'll kill you.,,,
"Oh yeah, it's illegal to curse right?",,,
What'd you fill my count at? What?,,,
"Oh yeah, that's.",,,
[inaudible 01:40:29] why are you bulling me today?,,,
Why are you bullying me?,,,
I don't even know.,,,
"The load max, probably stick to zero somewhere in here. [crosstalk 01:41:16].",,,
Source.,,,
I only looked at like the first A.,,,
Okay. So J's gonna be the value of the max value ... square roots found.,,,
Oh.,,,
"Nope. Is this wrong, somehow.",,,
I'm not sure. 'Cause it just like prints out multiple numbers. I'm just trying to figure out ,,,
why it's wrong.,,,
Oh I can't see the scroll bar.,,,
Yeah.,,,
"Yeah, look see there's two-",,,
Oh.,,,
"Oh, shooting your movies.",,,
"Wait, is this due tonight?",,,
Does your cousin like watch every movie?,,,
Huh. Maybe do L the loop? Oh no. [crosstalk 01:47:46].,,,
I'm just gonna leave then.,,,
Said I'm just gonna leave.,,,
I'm doing this-,,,
We can.,,,
Oh okay. We can.,,,
What?,,,
Did you like not get-,,,
Oh yeah print those [inaudible 01:48:15] combos.,,,
Yeah.,,,
"Yeah, we're all like where the stairs were.",,,
We like did real fast.,,,
Oh.,,,
I'm 25. [crosstalk 01:48:44].,,,
"Yeah, I feel you on that. Wait was Kyler doing? Isn't he working on his game?",,,
Skylers working on his game.,,,
Yeah. Yeah. With his friends so like at zero PCCC.,,,
Oh.,,,
Okay. I was going to try to figure this out real quick. So today is April 2nd. 13. 14.,,,
Yeah.,,,
"Yeah, I think it's right?",,,
"Alright. 'Cause, it returns the answers in here right? So it compiles the values into those, right? ",,,
Yeah.,,,
"That's what it does, right? Wait, is it part five?",,,
"Oh, part five. Never mind. ...",,,
"So part five is where you put in these two numbers, right? Put in this method. This is ",,,
"part five, right?",,,
Is it index?,,,
"When [crosstalk 01:58:10] the method returns in Array, of the Array's return.",,,
Isn't the inside called Index though?,,,
7.6.,,,
Which one?,,,
"Look at here. When it returns result, it just does the indexes of it, right?",,,
You don't have to go with mine if you don't want to.,,,
It seems like you really don't like that one answer.,,,
"Empty Array, different Array, part 3. ...",,,
Yeah.,,,
"This is footing values in the indexes, right?",,,
"So, we'd like, result of J? What are these arrow things?",,,
He made Array called List.,,,
In the parameter.,,,
Because it starts from zero.,,,
"Yeah, because you know how zero, one, two, three, four, five? When the length is eight, ",,,
it's actually at the seventh index because it starts from zero. You understand what I mean? ,,,
"Because then this is actually at seven [inaudible 02:02:05], like the ... [crosstalk ",,,
What do you mean?,,,
You go back there for a second? I just want to understand it. So it's saying if I equals ,,,`
zero J equals ... minus one. If I is less than the list of length [crosstalk 02:03:12],,,
"Yeah. You create an Array in this parameter, the list? A new Array could result.",,,
 Yeah,,,
This must meet up in the middle?,,,
What so you can pass Array's by invoking method. A method may also return Array. For ,,,
"example, the [inaudible 02:04:23] returns the Array that is the reversal of the other array",,,
One's actually the other.,,,
"You fill alpha one ... alpha index, you flip the one you think, and then we'll see who's right",,,
"Actually, you might be right. How many is it? One, two, three, four ... yeah, it might be  value",,,
I think you're right. ...,,,
"Oh wait, I thought [crosstalk 02:06:19] but there's only like, five [crosstalk 02:06:22]",,,
[crosstalk 02:06:23] letters.,,,
"Wait, what'd you put for five? [crosstalk 02:06:45]",,,
After the lines ...,,,
What'd he get?,,,
After the line is compiled?,,,
[crosstalk 02:08:03] Part three.,,,
After the line compile. ... Yeah that's makes sense right?,,,
"After these all compile they like, go in for like zero, one, two, three ...",,,
Was index right?,,,
Oh no.,,,
(Silence),,,
Oh I forgot to change fucking four and five. That's okay.,,,
I missed four and five.,,,
I changed three but I forgot to change five.,,,
This is 10 points.,,,
"For an argument of [inaudible 02:09:28], the value of the argument is a ...",,,
"[inaudible 02:09:39] Array. Referent values, passive and method, [inaudible 02:09:43].",,,
"[inaudible 02:09:47] ... Describe as pass by sharing, the area of the method is the blank as the ",,,
Yeah.,,,
(Silence),,,
"Before the method call, what is the value of A? ...",,,
Yeah. ... Where's the method call at?,,,
Where's method call? Do you see it?,,,
Why is it not named like a call?,,,
Where's the method call?,,,
"Okay, when we work on this one right? [crosstalk 02:11:30] When we work on this one?",,,
"Okay, I got you. Give me a sec. ... [crosstalk 02:11:54] ...",,,
"Oh, I think this is easier than they make it out to be. ... fives ...",,,
(Silence),,,
Oh this is call.,,,
"Alright. B, zero, before [02:12:21]",,,
It's gonna be six.,,,
Yep.,,,
"So, before call is over here in this one. Then this is the call one.",,,
"This is inside method call, so this is called Call.",,,
They label it for you don't they? See.,,,
Yeah.,,,
"The side of method M ... This is method M, the side of method M, right? Because this is what it's called. É",,,
Think about what would be displayed when we get the [inaudible 02:13:24].,,,
[Nom 02:13:24] equal one?,,,
What is it?,,,
Nom of one is three ... [crosstalk 02:13:42],,,
And then A ...,,,
It has to be [crosstalk 02:14:16],,,
We think it's 10. I don't know. I don't see where it calls eight again.,,,
"I think it's 10, I'm a put that. Fuck it. Because, it's getting too late [crosstalk 02:14:23]",,,
[crosstalk 02:14:28] because it doesn't say it. It doesn't have the option for 10.,,,
"Because look. Do you want me to show you? Which one, five to two? B is zero, is five ",,,
and then this [inaudible 02:14:56] zero is two.,,,
So five to two.,,,
After method call is two?,,,
"Cause you put A, B into M.",,,
"Right? Cause this is after method right here, right?",,,
Yeah.,,,
Which ones? Number two?,,,
"Ten, five, six.",,,
"One, two, three, two. ...",,,
Listen I'm just going to go with how [inaudible 02:16:13]. Ten and two. ...,,,
[crosstalk 02:16:27],,,
"I think it's true, isn't it? ...",,,
Alright.,,,
Scroll. ... That's not the one. ... What?,,,
Nothing's ... [crosstalk 02:17:19],,,
Yeah we did. First one. ...,,,
[crosstalk 02:17:29] false.,,,
That's my reference.,,,
Copies and values.,,,
And make a copy.,,,
I'm really sorry for ...,,,
"We, our condolences [crosstalk 02:19:21]",,,
Not in the scope.,,,
It's whatever. ...,,,
Is there an exit form?,,,
Yeah right! ...,,,
"Okay, did you all get the answers yet?",,,
,,,
"Yeah, he hit us up last night, or they thought you were gone.",,,
"Yeah, he missed you a lot. ",,,
Yeah.,,,
[inaudible 00:00:42] and put like David with a little heart. David [inaudible 00:00:44] heart. ,,,
"There's like a new TA. Oh so this is one, then.",,,
The value three? Four?,,,
It's just one. I'll need to retrace the steps. ,,,
"All right, make sure. I've only done my shit. I'm not even there. ",,,
"Wait, what did you get for number nine? ",,,
"Ball, a ball?",,,
But there's no six here.,,,
"No. Wait, where?",,,
Oh.,,,
I answered it wrong. My bad. Okay.,,,
Is this a binary search?,,,
Oh. My bad.,,,
I fucking hate this recorder. ,,,
I know. He's dropping.,,,
"Yeah. I just had no sleep, I'm sorry. ",,,
He starts crying.,,,
"Yo, what's up with ten?",,,
You have ten? ,,,
I like the code for like the binary-,,,
"Because, linear says you can do one or you can do power of one, array is, but binary search you're always going to do like seventy steps.",,,
What are you pulling out? ,,,
What are you pulling out? ,,,
14 didn't mean that. ,,,
Yeah his dinner. Which is-,,,
"Dude, your bag's O.G.",,,
And now?,,,
Go look at 269. ,,,
Small? First?,,,
"All right, now eight forty-four. ",,,
Or eight eight four. ,,,
Eight eight four.,,,
"Mm-hmm . (affirmative) Section 23 point 3, so just look at the section more than anything. ",,,
"Wait, why is yours messed up, is this Adobe? ",,,
No! What are you talking about?,,,
I've never had that problem. ,,,
"Like the theory, whatever. ",,,
"I don't, no.",,,
Yeah. ,,,
Four.,,,
A bubble sorts the array in-,,,
You just answered it. Smallest.,,,
A bubble sorts an array in blank. ,,,
A bubble sorts an array in blank.,,,
"Just go to 23.3, that's the section. ",,,
I think trust the section more than anything.,,,
Sorts the array in blank. So what is blank? ,,,
It would have to be in this section. ,,,
Is either a single or multiple?,,,
A multiple or a single. A multiple or a single. ,,,
It was right in front of our face. If it was a snake it would bite us. ,,,
I don't know. Do you actually have to watch this video? ,,,
"Five, three, two...eight.",,,
"They swap...Oh, is it the one where like they test a first one, then the second one, then the third one? Because look they swapped it for the...I fucking hate this.",,,
"I think I know how to do this one. See how they swapped the first one, because it's missing this? ",,,
Swapped it. ,,,
They're testing one and zero. ,,,
Goddammit. ,,,
Which one? ,,,
What is four? ,,,
Multiples or singles?,,,
"Oh, so this one? ",,,
Headphones?,,,
"That'd be annoying, hearing double in your voice. ",,,
It's like having two twitch streams open-,,,
Huh? ,,,
Wait these two are the same for me though. ,,,
"Three two five eight, three two five eight. ",,,
"Two, three, five. ",,,
Eight. ,,,
"Seven, nine, eight. ",,,
The third one?,,,
"Number three, can you say it for me?",,,
"David. David, come here. I need you. I don't know how to use this. ",,,
13,,,
Six. Because I had to go to my TA's office hours because I have a huge test on Thursday.,,,
April 9th. Say yours again.,,,
Say yours.,,,
"Okay. Want me to show the PDF? My computer just shows up in every single mistake you can think of. Okay, what's its name?",,,
"[Mia 00:04:38], is that supposed to be telling us the size of it, or no?",,,
Is that supposed to be telling us what's in the array or the size of the array?,,,
"Yeah, is that generating random numbers in the array, or is it supposed to tell us, like, I don't know.",,,
That's going to be what? The size or the values of it?,,,
All right. Print the array of the right formatting.,,,
"Print the array of the right formatting. For example, if this row-",,,
What's that supposed to be? Just-,,,
"We are. So you're [inaudible 00:06:47] these x's. Look at the thing. Look, is it... something like that.",,,
I forgot. I can't tell you.,,,
Do you put that in the for loop?,,,
"So it makes a random one, I don't know.",,,
Okay.,,,
"Right here, right?",,,
"Main array, [crosstalk 00:20:12]. Or more importantly, the fact that this is all justifiable after it shouldn't be. All right, you should be able to do this quickly fix it, but...",,,
"Oh, okay.",,,
"Yeah, that's true.",,,
"No. Yeah, well, I looked out...",,,
This girl [inaudible 00:24:59] like both of them. This nested for loop.,,,
The book.,,,
The column and the row?,,,
Row.,,,
Yep.,,,
"Array.length, whatever your array is. That's opposite.",,,
Yep.,,,
Let me see what it looks like.,,,
What the hell? It fixed itself if you put a nested for loop in it.,,,
Does it specify how many rows and columns it is?,,,
What does the error say? Local variable has not been initialized.,,,
"Oh, I put this part. I did it [inaudible 00:27:46] like that thing.",,,
I'm just sleepy.,,,
"Yeah, well that's why, this is the-",,,
"Because this is just for getting the random numbers, but I haven't initialized the length or anything so I don't know how... what's the length supposed to be?",,,
"I don't know, I haven't made the-",,,
"I've indexed it, like how long is it supposed to be, the length?",,,
I don't know how... Do you know what the array is supposed to be.,,,
Are you going to try to print it?,,,
"But it's not going to print anything, [inaudible 00:29:30] send out anything.",,,
Yeah. How long are the arrays supposed to be in this? How long is the array supposed to be?,,,
Yeah.,,,
"Oh, the length?",,,
Separate what?,,,
"291. Or no, 314, I mean. Or 291. Yeah, that's right, 291.",,,
You out? Are you?,,,
[inaudible 00:35:48] it was 8:15.,,,
"He says he could do it by 8:15, it was easy.",,,
He's dead.,,,
He didn't sleep last night.,,,
"Hey, Q? Why is this out of bounds?",,,
"I made a for loop to generate random numbers for this one. And this one, I just tried to make their own column random.",,,
I think I made this okay.,,,
But it's out of bounds when I try to run it.,,,
"Is it? Oh, it's right.",,,
"It runs, but sometimes it's out of bounds.",,,
"When I run this, sometimes it's okay, but sometimes it gives me out of bounds.",,,
Oh.,,,
"All right, thank you.",,,
"Oh, okay.",,,
Just the first couple of parts? I haven't done the sum of it or anything yet.,,,
"I don't think the math.random is right for mine, but it should be right otherwise.",,,
"Generates the random row and column, you know what I mean?",,,
Making random numbers in the rows.,,,
Yeah.,,,
We're making progress.,,,
Do you see [inaudible 00:45:55].,,,
"The only thing that still might be wrong is the math.random, but the rest should be right. You got it?",,,
This is the for loop to print it.,,,
You do column...,,,
"It's basically the same for loop besides this part, really.",,,
"Just copy this part. This is to print it out, this is just to make the math... it's like one through...",,,
What?,,,
Which one?,,,
"It's the same exact thing, but you just do row column plus space.",,,
"Yeah, for row and column, to print out both of them.",,,
Maybe. I'm trying to see if this is right.,,,
I was supposed to get you that energy drink so you'd be amped up.,,,
"Get amped up, dude.",,,
It seems like you're dying.,,,
Only 20 games of League.,,,
[crosstalk 00:53:26] 25 minutes.,,,
"Sometimes, not really.",,,
Is this already late?,,,
"If this is already late, I'm leaving. Is this already late?",,,
"If this is already late, I'm just leaving it, doing it some other time.",,,
Because there's already a deduction no matter if I finish in the next 30 minutes or before 12 tomorrow.,,,
Yeah.,,,
Which one?,,,
So it's the same for loops.,,,
Or you put the same for loops.,,,
Nope.,,,
Thirteen.,,,
Thirteen.,,,
What does your first four loop look like?,,,
What does your first four loop look like?,,,
It doesn't work?,,,
Looks random.,,,
Still trying to get a...,,,
Make it like two by two and then circle.,,,
"Or like three by three. I mean, you could do that but... it wouldn't be that hard.",,,
It would take two seconds.,,,
