Oh God.
"[inaudible 00:00:18] Oh my God, this is actually ridiculous."
"Oh boy, public, static, void, main."
"God, why do I have to use everything?"
Sorry. I don't understand.
"Okay, we're done. Just be like ... I don't know. So we want the result to be true or false. So we need to make it boolean value."
Boolean. I'm doing the second code.
I'm doing the second one.
What is sign 0?
Wham-o golf.
"It's not ultimate frisbee. I play ultimate frisbee, disc golf is way different."
What?
Creamy. It's just uncomfortable to listen to that word.
Moist.
Do some ASMR with that. Moist.
The moist. The moist [crosstalk 00:02:49] my noodle.
"Alright, boys. I no comprende."
"How am I going to use your input, from doing this? I guess I would do this. Bang. Integer equal, oh, wait, integer number yeet ..."
Integer equals ... equal dot next. I need a scanner. Scanner system in. I also have a kitchen.
What is this?
I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. 
"Chris, now you return a string?"
"Hey, Chris."
Yes.
I wanna return even or return false.
"Even or odd I mean, not even or false."
"It says put in a number, and then put in a meth, and then-"
"Oh, it says put in a number and tell what it'll be odd or even."
Yeah that's what I was gonna do.
"Boolean, but like ... Yeah, but like ... For this part?"
"Yeah, but how does print ""This number's even"" and whatnot?"
"Okay, I don't get it."
Where?
"Oh, yeah, I see that. Yeah, but then I got this and I don't know what to do with that, so I guess that would be-"
Yeah.
"You twit, come on you dumbass."
"Oh, okay, so that's how you do that."
So-
Got it. It's already important once.
What's the point of this?
"Stop tabbing, I don't like that. Go back. No. I hate ... stop it, no, no, no."
"Ten ... three. Man I am having trouble typing today. Oh my God, I may have done it."
Alright y'all I think I did question two.
"My code works. Unbelievable. Oh, shit. It's too big."
"Alright, my code doesn't work. Dang."
It doesn't have to be a string.
"Oh, yeah it does."
I don't understand why my code isn't working.
Maybe should just put on my side.
I know right.
"Dang, my arm's getting tired. I only have one arm. Alright, what's hanging up there. Dammit. There we go."
"Shit. I don't understand. I just don't know how to ... [inaudible 00:15:40] this up. My damn if equal to. I'm doing question two, by the way."
"Oh my God, my code works. Oh yeah, it works! Alright, first one ... why won't just make this entire discord a group chat."
"My method works. Alright, how you doing on question one."
"I guess I'll help you out with that. This is activity 15, isn't it? Dang. This one is not easy. So it's gonna be a-"
It's gonna be four methods? How do you do four methods?
What?
"Oh, I get it. That's easy. Easy mode. Nevermind, that's not easy mode. Uh-oh, that's just a variable, oopsies. Okay."
"I don't know, this is dumb easy. So you just fill in all the formulas for each else-if. Is it gonna be else-if or do we do if."
For each one and then else.
Much better.
"Can't spell square, LOL."
I am talking to myself.
"What's a ""method""?"
"Yeah, this is just a bunch of if-elses."
"Yeah, but you have to use four methods."
"I'm sorry, I don't speak english."
I don't understand why we have write four methods when it's so much easier to do else-ifs like this.
"So then, it's correct, but where this is, should be a public et cetera for each bit."
I don't understand what you just said.
Okay.
Dumb.
"I've done nine years of building computers, and I've done two years of programming."
All I'm literally doing is-
I don't understand the using a method-
Yes.
Public static int ...
"So you do public static int one shape, public static int some other shape, public static int some other shape."
But why would I do that when else-if is so much easier?
When is it really applicable?

"Yeah, it's awesome. And then when you fix that one thing it all works. So great."
"No, it's not. We're not doing doubles. Too much work."
No.
Excellent.
Why is it called double in?
"Where does the ""in"" come from? Is ""in"" the input?"
"We just gonna change to whatever input was? Oh, wait, oh man. Oh, man. Oh my God."
No.
No.
This is confusion. Int-
"I kinda understand the ... Kind of. I understand the four methods and whatnot. But I don't understand when the input comes in. It's asking for ... You type in some side, how you tell the method to get ... Do I put the ... Fuck."
Including asking for the input?
"I would put ""ask"" in the input within each of these methods?"
"Okay, that makes sense to me then. Sounds great."
This thing is damn obnoxious.
Okay. Can I use the same variables within different methods?
"Oh, that's awesome. Okay, so."
I would do it.
I have to do double for circle. That sucks. I have to do double for triangle.
We're just gonna leave that on the ground.
That requires effort.
"Bubble. Supposed to say ""double"". Double bubble. Double-wobble, wobble-double. Wow, that's completely messed up. Out of curiosity."
I'm gonna declare size as an integer or whatever.
"Well, that sucks. So, what do I do?"
Just that?
"Okay, that sounds great."
All right. Let's get these scanners in.
Input cannot be resolved. Oh I have to call it.
Shut up.
I think Jesus is.
It's a variable just to bring it up.
"Scanner, scanner, scanner, blah blah blah."
Oh boy.
"Hey, Sarah?"
"Hey, Chris, I don't understand these errors."
Yeah. It says method must result a ...
"Oh, I need to put return up here."
"No, no, not intro, this is global science class."
Okay. And then what?
"Yeah, area. Is that it? Cool."
Okay.
Your side equals input.next. 
Dang. I started to do assignment two.
And I know there's no plug-in capable.
What am I going to do now? What's my life?
Chris.
What variables do I need? The heights and base?
You don't work.
Didn't work.
I'm dicks. I need dicks.
Why does that not work?
I don't like you.
This is just height times base all over it divided two.
Times base.
Makes perfect sense.
The scanner can do ... It's a thing-
Oh my god.
What did you do for the first part? Shape that equals ... 
"I don't get it. No, no, no. I have it all done, I just don't know what to do for the if/else stuff."
I don't understand this. What? Double S ... Wait. Square.
I don't understand why you're doing double S square. I don't get that.
I don't understand why that entire line is there. So is it-
"So, for me it would be like this. It would be int, S, equals-"
Square.
"Well, that didn't work at all."
"Wait, what did you call? You called ... Oh, fuck this shit. This is so fucking stupid. Double A, area, return A. This is so ... This so does not make sense."
I don't get this. What?
You get both of them.
I get both of them. All right. Stop the recording. (silence) Did he fuck it up last time?
"Fucked up, okay."
My number is 22.
Kind of jump in here because we're going to turn.
This is unbelievable. We have to be so close.
Scoot over. Over there.
"All right, I'm still 22. "
Who's 47?
The window.
It's so bright.
"Everything is awesome. Everything is awesome. Hey, Andrew."
"Andrew, how is everything?"
Why is eclipse taking so long to load?
It's because of those files you installed. You don't have to install anything to make it dark.
It all makes sense.
All of it makes sense.
"All right, y'all, this is going to be so easy."
"All right, y'all. We're going to fill an array. You ready to make an array? I'm ready type make an array. I'm ready to make an array. Wait, how do you make an array?"
Where there's a will there's array.
Where there's a way there's a way? Is that a Chinese way of saying [crosstalk 00:54:04]. It sounds like my professor trying to say ...
Sounds like my professor trying to say there's a will there's a way. There's a will there's a way.
A will a way.
Huh?
[crosstalk 00:54:15] a will there's array.
"Yeah, my professor. She has a really strong accent. She can't say her Ws and Rs very well, so they kind of sound the same."
"So, there's a will there's a way."
What are you doing? Stop it.
"Yeah, but we have to give the input for how many we want."
You take the user input.
Awesome.
I'm tired.
Microaggressions. UNC Astral has a literal lecture for orientation about microaggressions and all that. It's the worst thing I've ever gone through.
I'm a macro aggressor. I offend the whole college.
If you take away their ...
"Still a pain. Did someone say crack? Hey how do you make an array? Go to the array thing. Go to it, hurry, hurry, hurry, go, go, go, go."
You mean ... Sugar making you hyper is actually a myth. It just gives you diabetes.
"Hey. Okay, I probably should do that. It'd be really obnoxious to hear."
Go back to-
Oh.
Does it have to be a double?
"Oh, true."
That's an array right there.
That's an array right there.
"Look, see, I did it right."
"Yeah, I told you. I literally told you like two seconds ago. We had to get the ..."
"Oh, so that's how you make it."
Do you have to use the brackets?
"I see. No, go. I just want to get the format. That's all I need. All I need is the format. I can be done with this code. Where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it?"
Hello? Like this. Hello? Oh god. What is new ENT? What?
"Boy, somehow do I put stuff in the array? Oh, I've got another loop, right?"
You make a loop like in the array with that?
"Okay, so do you just make a loop that ..."
"Well, yeah, but like what? I'm so confusion."
I'm trying to figure out how to put data in an array.
"Wow, this answer has negative two. Why am I on this website? Terrible."
Maybe you shouldn't admit that over forum.
"Oh my god. I figured it out guys. Check this shit out. Are you ready for this, you ready for this, you ready for this, you ready for this, you ready for this? So, this puts 10 in slot zero. This puts 14 in slot one. This puts two and slot two."
How does the four loop go again?
I hate you. And equals zero.
"Is I less than, equal to array length?"
"And then we do, and then we do, and then we do I plus, plus."
Jesus.
"I think I've figured it out, random [crosstalk 01:02:25]."
I don't get it.
Let's see here.
"Area number, my array, I equals shit on a stick."
How do I generate a random number? I forgot.
It's like ... Fuck. Oh god.
Number.
Holy crap. I have to go back to my notepad. Damn it. I have to go back all the way back to some bullshit.
You are such a ...
Number of grades.
Cannot convert double from int.
I don't want to do method at random.
Oh my god. I can't generate a random number. Fricking integer.
"No, I don't know how to generate a random number that's not a double, and I need-"
"Up there, but it won't let me do ENT."
You have to do ENT. That's obnoxious.
But now I'm still getting an error? Unbelievable.
Number may not initialize numbers up there.
My array looks really funky. [crosstalk 01:09:25].
How do I print the values?
That sounds awful.
"Oh, it's still not even doing a thing right-"
Sounds great. Amazing.
"Oh, it's another four loop. Interesting. [crosstalk 01:11:34]."
Impossi-brew.
Ron Stoppable. [crosstalk 01:12:08].
"What? Number's a random number. It's generated up here, then it's printed to there. [crosstalk 01:12:39]."
Maybe. [crosstalk 01:13:22].
Something.
I've got some thingy-wingys.
So many loopy loops.
"It's loops, and loops, and loops, and loops, and loops, and loops, and loops."
Why? What's wrong with my thing? Oh god.
"Oh cool, I did it guys. [crosstalk 01:17:07]. Boom. [crosstalk 01:17:12]. "
It's got to print 100 times.
No. I've got to figure out what's wrong first. [crosstalk 01:17:34]. What is el wrongo? [crosstalk 01:17:43].
I need to delete this one. [crosstalk 01:18:52].
[inaudible 01:19:31]. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. Check it out. [crosstalk 01:19:33]. Largest number's nine.
"Roy, I have to check it. I want to get rid of the printing thing. [crosstalk 01:20:01]. Do you have to print the array? [crosstalk 01:20:03]."
Where?
"I'm confusion. [crosstalk 01:20:21]. Wait, how do you print the index? [crosstalk 01:20:21]."
"Index. [crosstalk 01:20:32]. Yeah, the I value, but ... Holy shit. Jesus. [crosstalk 01:20:43]."
It's inside the loop. [crosstalk 01:20:54].
You have to pull it out of the loop somehow. You have to make ... [crosstalk 01:21:02].
"Roy, I'm using I, J, and K for each of my loops. I don't know how to pull out an index from a loop."
I don't know how to pull out the index for the max value that I found. [crosstalk 01:21:25].
"Yeah. Max equals my array, add something in the loop [crosstalk 01:21:32] goes through here on J. How do I pull that J out? [crosstalk 01:21:35]. Do I just need J? [crosstalk 01:21:38]. No, I can't do that."
My array dot ... Okay.
Blank.
It's gonna work. Watch. [crosstalk 01:22:23]. Dang. [crosstalk 01:22:28].
No.
It aways is.
"Oh, and then you just print J plus J. That's just [crosstalk 01:23:06] ..."
"Index. [crosstalk 01:23:08]. Yeah, I get it. [crosstalk 01:23:11]. Oh, wait, no it wouldn't because it's in the loop."
"Roy, why'd you put it in the loop? [crosstalk 01:23:20]."
"God, [crosstalk 01:23:24] Chris, come on dude. [crosstalk 01:23:25]. No, it said [crosstalk 01:23:29] index may not be able to initialize, and my array, delete [crosstalk 01:23:33]. Wait, where's my array? [crosstalk 01:23:33]."
"[crosstalk 01:23:45] be five, six is the index [crosstalk 01:23:47]."
Where did you find this?
[crosstalk 01:25:08] to me? [crosstalk 01:25:09].
"It's in the book, dude."
Noggin. [crosstalk 01:25:14].
"I don't have a noggin. [crosstalk 01:25:17]. Do you know how to print a comma in array? Like print out the array, and then put commas and spaces in it to separate [crosstalk 01:25:30]? I can get the array, except for [crosstalk 01:25:37] I want to put commas and spaces [crosstalk 01:25:39] one. [crosstalk 01:25:41]."
"Yeah. [crosstalk 01:25:42]. I guess this is the [crosstalk 01:25:45] right here, so what do I just do? Oh wait, then I would just do this. [crosstalk 01:25:48]. Yeah, [crosstalk 01:25:56]."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, I got it. [crosstalk 01:25:57]. Yep. Yep. I got it. So easy. [crosstalk 01:26:03]. Comma, plus. [crosstalk 01:26:08]."
"Man, that is the best looking array ever."
Except I have a comma after the six. That looks stupid. [crosstalk 01:26:20]. How do I get rid of that last comma? [crosstalk 01:26:25]. I would have to do an if something. I'll just do a space. Fuck it. [crosstalk 01:26:38].
Brain dead. Brain hurty. Now you've got to [inaudible 01:26:51] the average of all the elements. [crosstalk 01:26:54].
I've got to do something tomorrow. I don't know what.
"Yikes. [crosstalk 01:28:18]. All right guys, more loops. Here we go. [crosstalk 01:28:22]. Jesus."
I know. [crosstalk 01:28:34].
"All except F. [crosstalk 01:29:05]. Oh my god, I've got to do so many variables. J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V. Oh, and [crosstalk 01:29:38] letters. [crosstalk 01:29:39]. Total [crosstalk 01:29:47]."
"What's wrong here? [crosstalk 01:30:02]. Oh, let's just make it equal to zero. [crosstalk 01:30:31]. Average [crosstalk 01:30:31] equals total divided by [crosstalk 01:30:31]. "
I'm doing great. [crosstalk 01:30:44].
"Five plus seven, plus six, plus seven, plus six, divided by five. [crosstalk 01:31:20]."
"12, 20, 26. 31 divided by five. All right, my average works. Sweet. Next. [crosstalk 01:31:41]. Find all elements that have a higher value than the average value. Oh god."
And then [crosstalk 01:32:00] array called high values.
So many loops. [crosstalk 01:32:16].
"At J, K, L, M equals zero. [crosstalk 01:32:27]."
I want to get this done.
Really? [crosstalk 01:33:02]. I'm about to be finished. [crosstalk 01:33:06].
Thank you. [crosstalk 01:33:13]. (Silence).
22
No.
You're 21.
"Yeah. No, you're 21."
I'm 22.
"All right, looks like the activities [crosstalk 01:37:20] are open. Wait, there's activity A, there's activity B, and there's activity C, that doc. Then, there's activity C submission. What are we doing for activity A and B? [crosstalk 01:37:29]."
"Oh yeah, we could all circle. [crosstalk 01:37:36]. Oh god, this is not gonna work. Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god. You've got to go under the table."
"I can't [crosstalk 01:37:48] it off with my right hand, because of that. [crosstalk 01:37:52]. This is my ..."
Turn your fist around. [crosstalk 01:37:58]. How many [crosstalk 01:38:04].
All better.
Okay. Are we doing ... What are we doing? I don't understand. Huh?
"You have activity 18 A, B, and then C doc, and then there's only activity C submission."
That's that transitive property.
"Oh, it's a quiz. Oh."
"All right, let's do these quizzes real quick. [crosstalk 01:38:54]."
"Sarah never answered my email. Oh man, this is so much work already. I just want to go home. I'm so hungry."
Sounds great. [crosstalk 01:39:14].
"I don't know, is it? [crosstalk 01:39:27]."
"Isn't this possible? Except ... No, it's not possible, because there's not enough variables. [crosstalk 01:39:37]. You would need an int W, int V, int X, and int whatever, Y. You would need four integers essentially, right? [crosstalk 01:39:48]."
"No, but you're doing four different things."
"We have defeated him before he got ... I just realized how we're just using X and Y to multiply, and divide, and plus, and subtract it. That's what I just found out, guys."
Can you return all four answers? [crosstalk 01:40:15]. Oh. You put them in array and then you can return them? Yes.
"Index zero's addition, and index one is subtraction. Index two is [yeet 01:40:31], and then index four is something else. [crosstalk 01:40:34]."
Yeet.
Yes.
No. You've got to put them in a goddamn array.
"That's not an ... Oh, that is an array. [crosstalk 01:40:46]. You're not even printing it. You're just running it, not printing anything. You've got to print it-"
That's not printing anything.
Good go man. Part one.
Good go man. Part one.
Brah.
No. It's just an empty array isn't it?
"Then, part two [crosstalk 01:41:41] ... Why is part five after part one?"
All right. Part two ...
"All right, it's a different array with four values. [crosstalk 01:41:57]. Four, size four."
"After the array is compiled, it's going to be eight, four, twelve, zero"
"Yeah, because it hasn't run the next line yet. And part four is going to return it. Wait. Isn't four ... Oh, 6 divided by 2. Okay."
Part 5 array equals a-
"No, you did that in part four."
So the array is set to the new one.
"Alright, fill in that blank."
What is that? The blank of the array is returned.
The-
I mean the values are ... Is it value or values?
"I mean, we've just got to search for it in the book apparently. Here we go."
The reference of the array?
Did I spell reference right? Oh god.
No. Hopefully I spelled that right
"1.8 out of 2. That's not bueno. Oh, we missed part five. Fuck."
"What? Okay, that's so stupid."
Question 2 ... question 2 ...
Damn dude. We got a 90 on that. That's terrible.
"Alright. 1B, here we go. [crosstalk 01:44:52]"
Alright. Time to search for more stuff in the book.
Why are you doing that?
To study? Oh my god. This one is fucking 10 questions. Unbelievable.
Ant B of zero is 5. Ant B of 1 is 6.
I'm on quiz 2.
Number 2. I skipped-
I skipped number 1. I don't feel like looking up that bullshit.
It's reference and what?
Sane?
Same!
I don't need a hearing aid. I just need ... a hearing aid.
[laughs]
Inside the method. Blah blah blah. The value of num is equal to one. Juan.
Num zero is 2.
Three.
"for question three, isn't A outside the scope? It's not in that scope? Okay, great."
References. Oh god.
I think so.
Oh yeah.
Lab zero one.
"Okay, but after the call, what's A? No. I can't see what method ... I can't see that. You have to get to the code. Alright, I'm going to the code. Fuck it. After the method, 10."
"So after the method, it's still 10. And then after method's two. Oh man. Alright. Number five. That's false. It has to be returned, right?"
"I think it's not in the scope, but it should be right. It should be one, two, three. Isn't six also false, because it's not returned?"
"I got 10, five, six."
"Four, I got 10 and two. Did you all get false for five and six?"
"For five and six, are we assuming that the values are returned? Or not returned? Because there's nothing saying about returned, so that just means they're gonna be both false, because they don't update if they're not returned."
"But is it implying it? Well, it doesn't matter, because if it doesn't return, it's not gonna change anything, because it's gonna stay in that method, right?"
Alright. I don't know anything.
"Okay. An array is an object, correct?"
Why?
I don't understand why it updates.
"Why would a variable not update, but an object would? That makes no sense. If it's in a different scope, why would it change?"
Oh god.
Oh god. I don't wanna think about this.
So is that true for all objects?
How do you know that six is false then? Or true.
"Professor. I'm confused about question six. Like why are objects updated in the main method, but variables are not?"
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
"Does this apply for all objects in java? Okay. So because it's referencing its address, if you change its address in one method, it's gonna change in the other one, because you can't like ... They're not values necessarily, so they can't discern or whatever."
Okay.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
I know machine language. I took a class on it.
References or value?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
"So what we're pulling from the main method is the reference, not the value of the reference. So if you change the value of the reference in the other method, that reference points back to the main methods and changes that value, because you can't change values. Or like you can't change a reference. So ... Well, you can change a value in reference, but the reference is gonna change it in the other method, because there's only one ... Yeah. Yes. Okay, that makes sense."
"Yes. Yeah, that's fine. Potatoes."
It's eleven space five.
"Things and objects, and pointers and references."
"No, that makes sense. Like if you ... So alright, I'm gonna explain it so she doesn't feel bad when she's listening."
"Alright, I'm gonna explain this to you all here. Let me lay down the law for ... I don't know."
"Oh, what's your question?"
"So like, since it's an object, it doesn't pull the value from the main method. It only pulls a reference from that main method. So anything you do to that reference in the other method, whether it changes the value or anything, it's gonna change it in that sense. It's just a pointer to the other method. So-"
"You wanna agree, but what?"
"Alright, what's eight? Number eight."
Seven is 11 space five.
"One two one space five, yes."
This increase theirs.
Yeah.
"Wait, what did you say number eight was? What's number eight?"
"I said increase there is doesn't return a value while increase nine does not. I said that increase theirs doesn't return a value, and increase mine does. Is that the difference?"
Oh boy.
"Wait, so what's number eight?"
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Okay.
Okay. Got it.
"I love Jolly Ranchers. They're so good. That watermelon, oh my god, it's so good. Blueberries, and then grape, and then green appel, and then red cherry is the worst. Red cherry is just gross."
I don't like green apple.
"Yeah, I got them. Yes."
So eight. [crosstalk 02:03:51]
"Oh, can you go to question three real quick? Okay. So I got those. How about question one, references and same. Question two, ten, five, six. I think I got those too."
References and same? Or reference and same? Or references?
"Okay. Three, I got watching three not in scope. Four is ten and two. Five is false. Six is true. Seven, eleven space five C, and then copies. Is your submit button not turned green? Sweet."
"Alright, activity 18 is gonna be easy."
"Yeah, check out what I'm making. Uh oh. Where is it? Uh oh. That's not bueno. Well, I'll be a shit on a ... Shit. I deleted the workspace with the code that I was working on."
"No, it's long gone. I deleted the work space."
"Damn, that kind of sucks. Oh well. She smelled it from over there."
"You know what? I really don't feel like doing anything right now. I just wanna go to sleep, and eat some chili."
My roommate made some chile. I'm gonna smash a bowl of it when I get home. It's gonna be so good.
"But you're the TA, so you can do that. You can do that. You can, because you're the TA."
"I deleted an entire workspace for a long ass thing of code I was doing on accident, and now I can't get it back."
You can't bring back a workspace like that.
I deleted the workspace.
I didn't realize I didn't put the code in this workspace. It was in another one.
"It was so long. It was like 400 lines or something. Now it's just gone. It was parking meter check thing. Like it would check if a parking space was open, and if it was closed, it would have the time remaining on that parking space."
Just for fun.
"Oh, I'm not doing that. I'm parked-"
"So yeah, got rid of that entire code, but it was messed up anyway, so it's okay. [crosstalk 02:08:49] I know how to make a timer in java. It's kind of complicated, so I just copied and pasted from [inaudible 02:08:54] overflow, and it would print like the current time when you printed it every time I ran the code, or every time you did a loop or whatever. And I wanted to print in real time what the timer [inaudible 02:09:07] is, but I don't think you can do that with this compiler, because that would require you to like ... like I'll give you an example. So like, maybe I have it ... I don't have it saved on here either. Unbelievable. Alright."
I don't want java script.
Let's see. There it is. This is the exact code that I used. So we go-
"And you go into my IDE, and we say ... Oh shit."
So you can't print it in real time in one line. You have to do it like that.
"And that's the issue I'm running into. I'm like, ""Oh, I would never be able to do this in java, so there's gotta be some other way I can do it."" So if the time is less than 10 seconds, say less than 10 seconds if the time is less that 30 seconds, or it's less than a minute or whatever [crosstalk 02:10:22] and you can't like do it in one line."
See what I mean?
"I don't think there's any way, because it just goes line by line. [crosstalk 02:10:44]"
No.
Yeah.
I don't want any package. [crosstalk 02:11:39]
"Buddhism, more like booty-ism. When's this assignment due? I'm gonna do it later. Dang it. Activity C is due at 8:15. You, you wanna pick me up?"
Alright. Pick me up.
"Alright, I'll walk home."
Can we get an extension on this?
Because it's due in three minutes? Nb                                               

I am 22.
I'm trying to use this table building API and it-
Oh great.
"So, it wants me to import some sort of package and I have no idea what that means. So even if I tell it to create the class or whatever... oh, it wants me to clean a whole fucking class. Holy Shit."
On Stack Overflow. So it prints out stuff like that.
But I want to because it's going to make it way easier and take way less [inaudible 00:01:08].
"Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
"Oh my God, I'll just do this fucking assignment later. It's stupid."
We're doing activity 19?
Oh it's just a quiz?
Oh God. What's question one?
"Hey Sarah, [crosstalk 00:02:25] have you ever used table API? Great, yinz are useless. What's number two?"
Yes.
"Yeah, and that's not what I want. I want that last column lined up perfectly."
"Yeah, this project is an F."
You're wired up. I don't care.
What's number three?
We'll examine the above method. Mystery method. You need an array and you need the key. Is that a selection search?
I think it's a selection sort.
Because there's like... it's... it's-
There's nothing. It's nothing. You're just looking at what type of sort it is... or a search or whatever.
Is this a linear search? I think this is a linear search.
I think it's a linear search but I have no idea.
That makes a lot of sense.
Cool.
"Four, let's see, [inaudible 00:04:53] looks like this."
Number's three.
"Let's see, number's three."
That'd be one.
They got to put it up there.
I think you should- Don't you have to put it before that?
Told you.
"Told you. Told you, told you, told you."
"Do, do, do, do."
Told you it was one.
"Let's see, Amanda lives like this. Number's eight, that's going to be a negative one."
"Number six, let's see what [inaudible 00:06:07] may look like this. Number's six. That will just do the first one, so 0-1-2-3. Oh god. Oh, this is a binary search."
This is index one.
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Wait, does the array have to be sorted if it's a binary search? No, it doesn't because we just did-"
No because we just did without sorting it yesterday. I want question nine.
Is it binary search?
Does it look like this? Since we're search-
"Since we're searching for six, it checks the middle and then it checks the bottom half. It keeps cutting it in half until six is found. Is that how that works? Is that what a binary search does? I have no idea."
"Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
Eight is one.
"Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out. I think it's D or it's A."
And then you need to rename it to snippet.
"Found index. [inaudible 00:08:26] Oh, you don't have to? What? That is actually insane. Wait, so it's three?"
"Wait, for what?"
Three is not an answer. [inaudible 00:08:46] The code is wrong.
"Yeah, exactly. I think it's wrong. So, what do we do? Oh wait, don't you put that in next up there? Print the index and it made nothing."
"No, it's just going to do the first half."
No. The fucking system [inaudible 00:09:37] print line in the main method.
"No, that's not in the main- That's the- Oh. Put it in."
Oh. What the fuck.
"Well, the answers is wrong."
"Not a surprise, I guess."
What?
"Well, hang on, the code is wrong. The code is wrong for this question, we can't do it."
For question eight.
"Because it's doing a thing where we- Where it's not counting the right, like, thing. From yesterday, you remember? Like it would start in the middle but it really isn't a middle because there's like a odd or something numbers and it's doing the same thing in this one."
"Oh, why are we getting all this wrong ass code?"
"Probably. Hey, this code is wrong."
"Here, for question eight."
"Yep, this is question eight and it's wrong."
Because the output is none of the answers.
You actually don't have to. Look at it. Check this out. Check this out.
Yup.
"Yeah, but the answer is three and three is not an answer."
"What's your return for found index? So, we- We have that code in there and we printed value of found index after the method runs and it's giving us three and three is not an answer, even though it should be printing one."
"Yeah, it's up here."
It's right there.
Yup. It's literally doing the same thing as yesterday where it's-
So...
...all of these codes in the book are wrong.
"[inaudible 00:12:46] this wrong ass code for our quiz, it's ridiculous."
"No, we should automatically get an A for pointing out all these errors. For question A and this."
"That's an A, that's right."
"So, it gives us [crosstalk 00:13:11]"
"That does a binary search of whatever the array that's given here and so I want you to do number six and to this method and so in number six you should get one, right? Because one- Six is a index one and that's the index you want to return but when we do this code it gives us three. Which doesn't really make sense."
"I think it's like doing the same thing with the code yesterday where it would- Like, since there's not really a middle because there's a odd number. No wait, no, there's like even numbers, so it should-"
[crosstalk 00:14:06] They don't take in many way.
"I know, they're all from the book. That's the funniest part. Like, I know the answer is one."
"And then it does it like this, so. I don't know. Why is this code wrong?"
"But if we're using this, I-"
It's going to be great.
I just want to know how- I just wonder how to do this table API.
"Wood, we've congregated all the TAs and the professor over here."
"Chris is like ""What the fuck."""
This is ALT-TABing but with your body.
Professional advice from Chris.
Do we do negative one or do we do one now?
"Oh my god, what do we do? Can we type in an answer?"
"Oh, we get three tries on this?"
Yes!
"Oh, but it's one, it's got to be one."
How are we supposed to know if it's intentionally an error? I think I'm just going to leave it at one because that's what it's supposed to output.
"Well, the other answer choices are-"
"Binary searching doesn't have to be sorted, correct?"
"Binary doesn't have to be sorted, right?"
"It does? So, this isn't sorted. Is that why?"
What?
You do have to put in order for a binary search?
Sweet. It's negative one.
Nine?
"It's not supposed to like compile air, so it's going to be- It's going to return negative one. But why is it returning three? Wait! Wait!"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Chris!
It's returning three though. Why is it returning three?
"Yeah, but if it's not sorted it would return negative one according to this answer but it's returning three which is the middle element."
"Even though there is no- Well, there is a middle."
You know what? I want to go home and eat a burrito. Don't steal my burrito. All right.
"Our record should be- Yeah, it's on."
"Sarah, [inaudible 00:19:11] nothing looks like this."
"Again? All right, where is the search method? Oh my god, question ten is ridiculous."
What's twelve?
Smallest first? That's what she said.
And then what's-
What's the second answer?
"Oh, smallest first. I get it."
"So, then what's-"
"Why does it say, ""first check and third""?"
"A bubble sorts in array in multiple phases, right?"
"It's not in the book, unbelievable!"
"Just do search ""bubble""."
That's why I said each successfully- Each pass successfully swaps the last element if the elements are not in order or is the neighboring.
It's neighboring. Look at finger 23.3 and [crosstalk 00:20:59]
Oh...my...god! Is this going to give us the right answers? Because this is ridiculous.
I used to but it sucks.
I also play Dishonored. It's a great game.
"Sorry, not interested."
Okay.
Okay.
"Wait, is this due A15 because if this is due A15, I'm not going to be able to finish it."
E-sports are sports.
You don't watch E-sports?
Oh okay.
"Um, what do you get for question 16?"
Is 14 just a bubble search? Because that's what we just answered above. I totally think it's a bubble search.
It's got to be a bubble search.
Oh my god. It's a bracket issue.
"CONTROL-F11, proceed, boom, it's- Exception."
What's wrong? Why is snippet wrong?
"Do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
And then voilà. It's not- Oh.
"Unbelievable. All right this is performing a bubble sort, it's got to be."
"Dude, it's got to be a- Let's just go back to the question. A bubble say sorts the array in multiple phases."
What?
How different?
How much different is it?
"Is there like a temporary variable or anything? Oh yeah, there is, look. Up there."
"It's a [inaudible 00:24:15], it's got to be a bubble sort. That's a bubble sort."
"No, you're a bubble asshole."
Hey is this a bubble sort?
I have no idea. That's a bubble sort.
"Wait, that's not a bubble sort. Oh well yeah, that's a bubble sort."
That's got to be a bubble sort.
It's got to be a bubble sort.
What else is it going to be?
"Yeah, just tell us what it's not."
[inaudible 00:24:49] search.
I think it's-
It's got to be a bubble sort.
"Because we just answered the question that asked what a bubble sort was, so it's got to be a bubble sort by that logic."
It's a bubble sort.
Oh my god! Why do I have to do this?
Are you serious?
I don't want to do this right now. This is so much work.
I'm absolutely positive.
It's a bubble sort.
And 16 is merge.
"Yeah, it's got to be."
I don't know. It's like a bubble sort but it merges.
Merge!
It's selection?
"Ah, ah, it's selection, you're right. You're right. Oh, 17, now we got to do this."
15? I have no-
I have no idea how it- 15 and 17.
"Yeah, how do we know this is even going to work? How do you do question ten?"
"All right, we should want to take an L and get like a B on this. I'm kind of-"
What the fuck!
"I know, right? It's due at nine, so we got to stay here and do it."
Yep.
"Yeah. So, let's get it done."
"All right, who wants to work on question ten? Who wants to work on question 15? Who wants to work on question 17?"
"Yeah, Joelle, do you have ten?"
Question nine C.
14 is bubble sort.
"Dude, are we just going to not do three questions? Because I've got a feel on that."
"So, action sort is the last one? Which is like question 16 or something."
Bubble sort.
"14 is bubble sort, 16 is selection, I think."
Why? Do you think it's the other way around? Or do you not think at all?
"Hey, what class is this?"
Are you serious?
It's searching.
17 is asking you to make arrays.
Or value the array.
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, for 17 we can just plugin the mystery and then, um-"
"No, it's not. So, you just got to-"
You're calling it mystery ray or mystery method.
"So, print mystery method and then do two in the thing. No, no, no, no, just print. It's in the print decease."
"Done, done, done, done, do, do, do, do, done. Do, do, do, do."
What?
"Why not? Oh, it's a import something? Java.[inaudible 00:30:08].[inaudible 00:30:10]"
"Here, what's the error? No, print mystery method three. Like in [inaudible 00:30:20] it's called mystery method. No, like, the number, the number three."
No!
What? No! Stop it! This! Fuck!
"Numbers isn't even in here. So like, mystery method, numbers, numbers. Oh."
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe it's- Nevermind."
This is ridiculous. I don't know what the fuck-
I kind of just want to take the L.
"Why did you take the L? Wait, we got three attempts, don't we?"
"Taking the L, here we go."
"Oh, does it show? Does it show? Does it show? Oh god."
Oh no! So we have to figure it out.
Searching.
"All right, I guess we're on the end, let's make sure all the shit's right. 14 and a 29? Oh."
Fuck!
"Zero and a five? Oh my god, it just lost us five points, it's literally three quarters of our grade. So, probably got everything else right though. Holy shit!"
Did you get the wrong answer for it?
Oh god.
"Yeah, it's what we did."
Sucks to be you.
"We- All right, so like, three of those-"
We have no idea how to do number 17.
Um-
Yeah. For three of the questions I have literally more than half this grade.
Greater and less than what?
Greater and less than what?
This?
"You can't, it doesn't work."
"We've tried it, it doesn't work, so we don't know-"
"Why- Yeah, like-"
This is bullshit.
"No way! Did you get it right, though?"
"Yeah, so like, if we get the three things where it's [inaudible 00:34:41] is wrong, it's like-"
"I know, I can't bring my grade up anymore."
Yeah.
"Yeah, you fucked up my poll. It's ridiculous."
"He clicks clear response as the poll fucking launched, I mean- And I got the answer right."
"Oh god, that was so-"
I was meant to choke.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"All right 15, go."
Yes.
3
Okay.
Okay.
All right what?
16 we got selection?
2-3-5-8-7-9. Wait.
"Wait, wait, wait. 2-3... 2-3..."
You're missing a number for number two.
1-2-3-
4-5-6-7. You just do a space.
"2-3-5-8-7-9, 2-3-5... 2-3-5-8-7-9. Yeah, look, there's missing- This must be seven numbers."
We're missing the six.
"Oh yeah, what's ten?"
"Oh, here."
"2-3-5-8, 2-3-5-8. Oh no."
"2-3-5-8, 2-3-5-8, fuck."
"Wait, what?"
What about 17?
"Yeah, we got to redo it."
You forgot the number.
"Yeah, what's ten?"
Oh my god!
"I don't want to read it really carefully, I just want my 100."
2-1. Six is accurate.
Seven.
One.
What's three?
Smallest. Smaller?
"So, it goes [inaudible 00:38:35] equals three, [inaudible 00:38:35] equals 33, smaller, two, one, six and-"
We got 15.
Now you're saying- 17? We forgot the six.
But we got 45 minutes to do this quiz.
Have we figured out that one?
"Wait, they're all the same. Why are they all the same?"
Ah.
"We have no idea what we're doing. 2-17-doing. It's the same for every single one. Two- Oh wait, no, it's not. Ah shit! 2-3-oh. 2-3-5-8-7-9-6-2-3 [crosstalk 00:40:17]"
2-3-5-7-8-9.
"2-3-5-7-8-9-6. 2-3-5-7-8-9. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
"Type ""SOUT"" then CONTROL-SPACE. It's the greatest thing ever."
Nope. It's prenamed the addresses.
"Done, done, done, done."
I just want to go home and eat dinner. So hungry.
Oh shit! Way wrong. I got a 5-3-2-6-7-8-9.
Hell yeah! 5-3-2-6-7-8-9.
And number four.
5-3-2-8-6-7-9? 5-3-2-6-8-7-9?
8-6-7-9.
"Look, we got your code to work."
It's your code.
What if it's 42?
I thought I was 69 and you were 420?
All right mic thing goes there.
Time to submit this presentation. What is this? 
Let me submit this power point real quick.
Wait wings and coding? That's a terrible idea.
"Hey, Chris I have a questiones."
"What are we supposed to do with this dodge R file? 'cause I've tried downloading it and using it in clips and it just, I don't know."
"Great, not downloading it ever again. What about this logs.text?"
Oh my god we are doing activity 20 today.
I don't want to.
"I don't want to. There's not a problem, I just. I just wanna know what that's for. What about that? Let's actually find out what that is. That looks so amazing."
Define a two-dimensional ray of n-th data type and name it main ray. Generate two random numbers between the two and nine inclusive to following inverse of the main ray. Fill the-
"A, B, C, D, E."
Hmm?
"I don't know what you are talking about. Oh, hey your link doesn't work."
I get 404 not found.
Yeah.
That's Ted Cruz.
"Oh, that's it. All right, let's download this bitch. Download with Google."
"Why? Oh, the pages work just fine. Sweet. And copy and paste for this link? Oh man, let me save this. Itsc, book! No dollars, sorry. Why can't it find words in the damn thing?"
But it should...
"Now it can. Shit, now it can't."
"Yeah, can you do this assignment for me?"
"Yeah, you can."
"I'm just so tired. I'm so tired. I'm tired of scrawling through this damn textbook. Why would this be? I want to download. Damnit. Sign up to download it. Unbelievable. How about I just save as... Nope that doesn't work either, shit. Did I happen to bring my textbook? I did not. I should bring that more often."
Yeah.
So I can look at it in class.
"It's a pretty big book, and it's pretty heavy."
What chapter is two [inaudible 00:08:06] arrays? Eight?
"God, I got like, three more chapters to go."
"Damn, that's really smart."
"So, tired."
"That doesn't work, website is taking forever to load. It's pretty bad."
Three other tabs.
"RAM, I know. "
Mozilla Firefox here I come.
[crosstalk 00:09:22].
"Damn, Mozilla Firefox isn't doing much better. Why is it showing the pages for a split second and then disappearing?"
"I just can't handle it, I give up. I don't want to do this program tonight. I'm so exhausted. Why not? Great. Oh really?"
"Damn, that blows."
I guess it is an easy program.
"Exactly, it's not easy."
"Two rows and three columns, you got it."
"Hold up, wait a minute. Hold up, I'm confusion."
"Let's see. The average of the columns are this, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3.0, 4. Yeah, its a sample."
Maybe it's a typo?
"So, it says we need. Wait a minute."
"It says, define a two-dimensional ray and give it two rows and three columns right?"
Just any rows and columns?
"Random, and random. I don't want to do this, I'm so tired."
[inaudible 00:12:38].
I don't know. I'm getting so sleepy.
I had nine. I had eight. I'm super allergic to everything.
I'm not.
"If I were allergic to bad grades I wouldn't be alive right now. Oh wait, if I was allergic I wouldn't be alive. Which means I have good grades."
Your hair or your beard? They don't let you have beards? That's so ass. I would never work at Chic-Fil-A.
Yeah?
"Yeah, it's awful, especially during Christmas time. Christmas this year, I had a family knock on my door at 6am and to sing me a Christmas carol..."
This code is giving me brain cancer.
"Damn, you got me there."
It's not a joke.
"Oh, what to do. So, I'm not getting any user input right? Or am I? Let's call this, not that. How do I call an integer thingy? Main array equals new array. Two by three. Is that how I do it? Of wait, it's not new array, it's new integer, LOL."
How to generate a random number? I have to do this all over again?
"That sucks balls. Generate one. Generate in text equals x, generate. What is this?"
"Nevermind, I figured it out. I forgot you can use integer as math.random. Input is never closed, what does that mean? [crosstalk 00:23:15]."
Why? All right.
How do you fill up an array? With loops? There's a loop. Sweet. Hey Andrew? Your math.random generator is a little bit off.
What?
"Yeah, I know, but it's a little bit off when you did it. So, it going to generate a number between zero and one correct?"
"You need to subtract, here I'll show you."
"So, you multiply it by nine and then you subtract two"
"No, it's times nine minus two plus one, or plus one plus two, and then it generates between two and nine."
"Look, that's right. I just went through it. Look the math.random works like this. If you want to generate a number between-"
"Yeah, plus one minus, plus min."
But it has to be in this case.
That's why we had the plus one.
I'm trying to explain how the code works and everyone is disagreeing with me.
"That's how I did it. So, Andrew. Andrew, there it is. This is where brainiacs is. "
" The plus two makes it go from, instead of zero to nine, it makes it go to two to nine. It goes, yeah. It makes it go from zero to seven, to two to nine."
"So it's math.random times in parenthesis nine minus two, closed parenthesis, plus one, closed parenthesis, two times plus two. So, essentially it's seven plus one, plus two. Basically, I just used the formula so it's easy to remember."
For this row
Yeah.
"Yeah, okay got it."
It's nine minus two plus one plus two. And if you want to test it just [inaudible 00:29:17] x and y over and over until you get two and nine.
Now we have to print out these arrays? Then I have to print these arrays and that's it?
What?
Yes.
"Damn, that looks so good. And now we got to do all this math for it, oh yeah. Try to figure the average of the numbers in each column of the main array, storing some variable."
It's going to be a double.
So we need to make an array for all the averages that we store.
I know. I'm ready to say it so I can do this tomorrow.
"And then, I just don't feel like thinking."

"So, Andrew out first four loop... Andrew, so out first four loop gets the number of rows, the second one gets the number of columns?"
"So, if we want to calculate the average of the columns we would have to use the second four loop to get a value of whatever of the index, and then put it in another array-"
Oh my fucking God.
Is x the number of rows? Or is x the number of columns?
"Main array, new integer, x times y. X is your number of columns isn't it?"
"I thought x is this, y is this way. So x is the number of columns then."
"A row goes this way, a-"
"Oh my god, I just have to ask, fuck. So, tired."
"I'm going to figure it out myself, I got it."
M by n?
"So, m that matrices, damnit, that's different."
"No it's not, maybe. We'll see. I'm just do it print message to see what it does."
"So, it goes down and then across."
"So, y is the number of columns."
"Oh, motherfucker."
Main row.length column plus plus [crosstalk 00:40:50] we want to add the average of the column so we want to do the [crosstalk 00:40:56].
[inaudible 00:41:16]. Main array of...
I already figured it out. Fuck.
Mm-hmm (affirmative)-
"Okay, for length. Fuck this, brain hurts. I need a new fucking integer. Holy shit."
Holy shit.
A hundred thousand! What the shit! Holy fuck you need to stop that right away.
"Make an array, it goes... Stop."
Get it loop? Loops?
Fuck. Like that? Crash someone's computer.
I'm doing this right.
"Oh, no."
"Chris I can't wrap my head around this, I need your help."
Fuck! This is so stupid!
"This is fucking bullshit, I can't stand this shit."
"I'm done with math, I'm so fucking tired."
But that goes through every...
Column.
I can't wrap my head around this and...
"By, yeah, I know how to make the array by random numbers, but I do not know how to get just the row, and put it into a array I guess. So, I guess what I have is this part. At least I copy and pasted this part of my [inaudible 00:48:27] four loop here to go to a column, or to go through each column, but that doesn't work because main not array x is just going to go by the row. Oh god I can't do this, it's just too much."
Integer rays has been working for me better.
"Integer ray, it just worked."
But then the code uploaded what I needed to upload still.
"I know, I've already done that"
"All right, so now I just print out that the average array..."
Well all I know is that's not your[crosstalk 00:50:04].
Is it going to be do tomorrow?
"Kay. I'm just so brain dead right now, and I got so much I have to do tonight."
"It's just, I don't know how to go through the column I guess. I know how to put everything in it's own row and column, I've done that. It's just I want to go through the column bro."
"So this is going through, my plan was to go through the column, make average array whatever [inaudible 00:51:05] by the column spot-"
X is up here is the row that I'm in. The problem is that it's not moving to the next row when I do this.
"So, I essentially just do this?"
Okay. Let's try this again.
"Hey, Chris."
What am I doing wrong here? What am I doing wrong for this part of my loop? I'm just trying to insert... What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Yeah?
"Oh, fuck. God damnit. This is too much. Just row."
I just want to throw my laptop across the fucking room right now. Just so pissed and tired.
"No, you're 22. I'm 21, no I'm 22, you're 21. "
"No, you're 21. "
No he's always been 21. 
You're 21. 
Fate. 
Why is this so if-ING?
We're all in this together. 
We don't want to know how much sugar you have in that bag. 
Ha ha it's a little late for that. Oh balls! 
I really fucked up. I'm just kidding. There are a lot of big words in here. 
And then turn it left. 
And left. 
What's that?
"(laughs) Well, don't know what it is, but it tastes good. "
Ha ha. 
I got the two layers right now. 
All right. 
"All right y'all, lets knock out this activity. "
You said not to touch it and I touched it. What are you gonna do about it? 
"Just gonna drink it, that's what I'm gonna do. What have you been washing it in?"
Oh no! 
I haven't started assignment three. 
"I have been so busy this week, it's been, it's been"
Ha ha ha. 
What's up. Dun dun duuuunnnn. That's gross. 
Ha ha ha. I'm not 45. The snowsberry tastes like snowsberry. 
"No. Hey Sarah, what time are your office hours starting tomorrow?"
Do you want to do the entire assignment three with me?
As. Comedy central. The snowberries taste like snowberries. 
"Yeah, I got some oxies. "
No. [crosstalk 00:04:59] [inaudible 00:04:59] 
I do. 
Whenever I have surgery. (laughs) and I've had a lot of those. 
"I had to, when i had my shoulder surgery. I couldn't like stand not taking it, like I had to, I couldn't stand it, I was in so much pain. Like, fuck it. I'll stay on it for three days and then I'm gonna go off. "
"Did they, all right, "
Ibuprofen makes my stomach hurt if I take it too often.

Just let it all out. Cry. 
I've got Benadryl in my car.

"Oh I was like, what? What did you do the activity on? Do you not have a valid license? "
"No, that's bullshit. "
"Well, it's still bullshit. It's 18 "
"Well, at least. "
You can either give it over the phone or in person. 
And a bouncy ball to keep you entertained while we steal all your information. 
"Can I get a boneless pizza? Please, boneless pizza. "
I want a boneless pizza. 
a boneless pizza. (laughs) did someone say boneless pizza?
How many rows do you want the array to be? 
"[crosstalk 00:10:06] oh no, I'd be fucking around with people the whole time. "
Sir are you have an emergency? Yes. Sorry what did you say? Yes. Did you say no? (laughter) 
[crosstalk 00:10:15] did you say no? Yes. 
No. Call max. Did you say turn on the lights? 
Yes. 
"Hey guys, how do you say No without saying No. "
Yes'n 
No'nt (laughs). 
"No'es. No, it's yes'n. "
Yes'n. 
"Now, how did you do it? For the timing? "
Hey. Have you told your parents that your gay yet?
Answer the question. 
"Okay, you're gay. No, I'm just kidding. "
"[crosstalk 00:11:44] My favorite fifth grade joke was, have you seen the clown that hides from gay people? And I'm like, No and then you just laugh at people. It's funny, I don't know, alright. "
Ha ha ha yes. 
[crosstalk 00:12:16] I'm a little worried. Where has this been?
You want a stick of meat? (laughs) 
"Spicy! Spicy! Hey I know something that is sweet and salty? [crosstalk 00:12:38] [inaudible 00:12:38]. I feel terrible because we have two women in here. There going ""stop, stopped"""
Why? 
But there are straight people who are sensitive too. 
Yeah. You choose what you get offended by. 
[crosstalk 00:13:20] there are no lines. (laughs) 
"[crosstalk 00:13:28]I was watching that, have you guys heard of, um, I can't remember his name but it's that stand up comedian that stutters. He got hit by a softball in the throat and he stutters. "
[crosstalk 00:13:42] It's like Eric lynch or something like that. 
"Okay well, this guy is really funny and he's like, he says, he has like a speech impediment. So he's like ""yeah, I'm a stand up comedian. So if you don't laugh at people with disabilities you're an asshole"" or something like that. I thought it was really funny. "
Ha ha. 
"Wait, how do I do this?"
That is a proper name. 
"Equals...[crosstalk 00:14:53] salt during number, B21. "
All right lets see if this works. Oh wait! Fuck!
"That was actually really great because we were all just like, the fuck? "
I don't vape. I don't know this. 
"Hey Chris, oh wait I figured it out. "
Are you sure? 
Dove? Really? For men or for women?
It is better. 
Or do you do yourself a favor and take a cold shower? 
Oh! I did it boys!
Lets just stop there. 
Oh my freaking god!
We have to make it into a method. Unbelievable! 
That's what she said. 
So good. 
"Ahh, no. (laughter) "
I feel so bad. [crosstalk 00:17:54] Aw dude have you seen that video where the guy like takes the aluminum foil and stuffs it with like 2/8ths of weed and just like put it in the air compressor thing and they just shoot in their car? 
Its awesome. They hot box their car in like two seconds. 
"Quarter, three quarter...what ever, I don't know, it was a lot of weed, it was a shit ton. "
Its a one fourth. Hey man! Can I get a fourth of weed?
"Dude, I order mine from the dark red so I don't have to get shot. "
Well I'm sorry about your hair color. 
Its kinda like black into gray into some weird blue. 
"Sarah! Sarah, what the heck man! "
Do you not care about us? 
"Everyone look at their screens, don't even look at her. "
"We can't keep a straight face, we don't know what we are doing. "
"Oh dammit. Hey guys, how do I make a method. "
Carefully. 
I already did that. 
"Oh sweet, I did it. (laughter) "
"So, if I'm like returning "
"(gasp) I figured it out. Thank you for telling me the answer. Public say int, can you say that one more time, I'm sorry. Public, say, int. "
"Um, so yeah. Public, say, int and then parenthesis? Or? "
"No I can't do that. And then, do I put a space here?"
That's right. 
"Perimeters should be X and y. Okay, X comma y. "
"Yeah, okay. "
"No, I have that teacher now. "
"Um, my stat professor is this asian lady who doesn't speak English. And she, so, it was great. "
"No, she's Korean. Kim's are Korean, aren't they? "
"Kim's are usually Korean, aren't they? "
"Yeah, she's Korean. Yeah, she doesn't speak any English, it's really bad. But I got a 75 on our first exam and the class average was a 46. And then randomly she just changed my grade to 100 today. So I'm like, sweet thanks! "
Stats sucks dude! I hate it!
"Oh, are you in algebra? "
Walton's been pretty good. Pretty solid. We had an exam today and I think I either got a 40 or 106 on it. So we'll see. 
"Yeah, cause there was like 50 questions, no like 2 questions on there that"
Aren't they great? 
So we do the lab before the lab starts. 
"Yeah, his office hours are his lab hours. "
"No, no. Were in his. Yeah, we have been in there before. "
"What? We've been in this class, what? And you've missed us how many times? "
"Aw man, I don't know what to name my parameters, parameters. "
What do you want? Dammit! Mother fucker. 
"Buh, ugh I don't know what I'm doing. "
Freaking. I'm such a moron. 
What else is new man? All right that's more like it. 
"You know, I'm not liking your presence all that much right now. "
"You know, I don't appreciate the hostility right now. [crosstalk 00:25:06] I know you ruined it! You ruined it so "
"What do I do? Jesus! Input can not be resolved. Oh yeah, that's right lol. "
"I mean the only weirder thing is to do this and to go over. Return, R. R can't be resolved to a variable. Excellent work. "
"Do do do, suck his nuts, oh I really shouldn't be saying that. (laughs) "
"All right, how do I return an array? "
"Return the name of it, I guess? "
So like? 
I'm on a boat. 
"I have one, have two, you're dead. "
What? 
"Its like pringles, you can never have just one. "
Oh my gosh. I got a card
"Hey, why am I getting this error right here? "
Yeah it is. That's what I did up there. 
"Wait, I am so confused right now. "
"Wait, what did I do up here? "
How did this work up here?
"No, it did. Maybe, wait, how did I do this, wait, I'm so confused. What's activia 18. It's kinda like this. How did I do this? I don't know. Oh, I totally forgot this thing right here. "
"I wanna make that the, I have that there. "
"I'm just gonna copy and paste it here. I made like, I got like half way through the program and I realized, oh I got to put this in a method. So that was fun. [crosstalk 00:30:18] "
A game! 
Yeah. (laughs) 
"But Isaiah, if we do that, you'll have to be able to pin it without him realizing. "
"(laughs) that sounds like what kids do to girls in middle school. The girls they like, www, you had some crushes on you. "
Wait back up why do you pepper on a pizza? 
"With pineapple? Oh I thought you were talking about crushed black pepper, I was like why are you putting black pepper on a pizza. "
I actually think I would eat that. 
"If it's like a peperoni, sausage, meat, ham, meat lovers pizza, I don't think that black pepper would be too bad. "
"I like either green peppers, red peppers, onions, with the sausage. All right y'all I made me method. Now, I don't know how to do this. "
"All right, how do I return. How do I like, so I made a method that returns and array. So how do I get it "
"No, I'm so confused on how to do this. "
The return type is an array. 
"Yeah, I've typed in return array 1. "
"Yeah, how do you do that exactly? "
I'm returning the? 
"I think I did. So that's the, I'm returning that array, like, I mean the double array, like I want to return that to here and print it. So do I just do array one? "
Is that how that works? 
Which is R? 
So how do you? 
"And, R can't reset to a variable. "
Printing out that array
"Yeah, yeah, ohhhh. "
"I got it, I got it. "
Its to the point where 
Yeah. Dammit! Mother 
"The main, hey Chris. I need you to explain what I'm doing here. I've confused myself. "
"So I want to return the array that I made in here back to my main method and I don't know how to do it. Like, I made my method and int with array with two dimensions. "
"And that, this is all correct, this prints it, I just want to return it back to the main method. And I don't know how to do it. "
And then I get an error. 
"So, I just don't even need that in there. "
"He needs help. So were not passing through the main method where the, so that's what that is for? Is passing it from the main method into that. "
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
So you just put 5 and 6 in here as well?
Or? 
And then the X and Y is somewhere in here that 
"Okay, I get it. Easy! Thank you. "
"Just bleach it. Three, one, two, three, one, Why? Why? Why? This is the color that everyone wants. "
Just do it for your graduation. 
"Ugh, my hair is beautiful. You will never get to this. "
No you didn't. Do you have picture evidence. 
[crosstalk 00:38:41] then it looks like it didn't happen. 
"Damn we got the average for the row, but now we have to get the average for the damn array. "
That's what I'm using. 
"Wait, it is? Wait, what? Activity 20? What activity am I looking at? "
Wasn't it?
"I'm very far, I just need to do one more method. "
Always. 
No it wasn't?
Um 
Activity 20 
Activity 20 only did the rows. 
"Activity 20, so. "
"Yes, I asked collectively though. "
Well at least until tonight. 
I have a question on it. 
I have a question. 
How do I code?
"Okay, but actually my question is I am trying to use activity 20 from yesterday and this is when we took the average of the rows and what not."
"Okay, then how do I make it easier? "
Is there like a method for making
I honestly used to have a buzz cut. 
Nope 
Holy shit. I used to have a big dick. Noah believes that.
"Okay this is not working for me. Public, static, one, two, three, lets go Army! "
"You look so sad in that photo. Like, I've made a tremendous mistake with my life. "
What 
A type of ant. How about you fuck yourself. 
(gasp) I gotta do something. I don't know what I did though. How did I do that. 
"So do I choose how much I put in to it. I don't know how to do that. Its a miracle I've gotten this far. This was just taken from 20. I know I've been cutting as I, cause then he also gave us the fucked up one where it's 99. "
Do you know how to
"So I want to use, where is it? I want to use array up here, the array that I had up here. "
"And pass it through. This so I type in array here. I get these fricking errors. Like all over the place and, uh, yeah, I don't know. "
"But like, it's named in my main method. "
"Yeah, that's what I did. "
"But, like that's exactly what I did. I just made it into a variable array and called it array. "
"So, and now I just want to use it in here. "
"It is static. So, okay. "
"Professor, I don't know how to do this? "
"No, I know how to do the second part. "
"I need to figure out, I know how to calculate the average of stuff, I'm just having trouble with the method calling. So like, I have it called average. "
The second part of the first question. 
"So like, we have the public static double average, and I want to put my array through it, and I named it up here, array from what I made it my original method here, called array. And whatever that method was. And I posted it like that. But now it's giving me an error that it wants me to rename brackets and stuff and I don't know what to do. "
Sure you can. 
Because I'm lonely and I like to sit in the corner. 
"Well, it's only there, and "
And then it's totally fine. 
Does it what? 
"Um, it should not get an input, or it needs my array to do it. "
"Yeah, "
"Uh, ARR. "
It should be right there.
"No, this creates the array and has a user input. "
Okay. 
Yes. 
Okay
Yes. But why do I have these bracket errors?
Um 
It's only when I type in something to the parameters is when it gives me the error. So you can delete and the bracket and the two braces won't give me an error. 
"Oh, there we go, yay. I need a scanner. Dude the hash browns at chick fila this morning were so fucking good. "
And the total equals 
A R R. 
"Wait, did we finish part one? "
Sweet. 
So 
I am confusion. 
Why is that wrong? I'm so fucking pissed right now. 
"Why is plus equals. This makes no fucking sense. No, this isn't right, oh my fucking god. "
I can't get plus equals to worked
You've given up? 
I'm getting a very strange error. 
"When I'm doing, when I'm adding in a term to my total. It says that I cannot do plus equals, and I don't know why. "
Is this not getting the value?
At whatever that is 
Right there. 
"So the term doesn't, is this not getting a term from the array? "
"Oh, that's right. So I need to do it outside of the loop. "
This is so fucking stupid. 
Int. Term equals zero. 
"Four, five, "
Nine
"One, two, four "
"Cool, I did the entire assignment boys. "
"Look Chris, I'm an expert. "
We already turned it off didn't we.

Everywhere. 
Hack that email.
Jesus has arrived. 
Here I changed his name to what it should be. 
Can I get my pizza boneless?
41. Inmate 41. 
Say our numbers?
I'm inmate 41. What inmate are you?
What are you all doing for Good Friday?
You all want to get to class. 
You all want to get really drunk Friday night?
Or my apartment. Or anyone's apartment.
Do you live at Heather Ridge?
I'm in Heather Ridge. Right behind the Harris theater. 
"Time to get drunk this weekend boys. On this Friday, for Good Friday."
I'm assuming everyone here is 21 right?
So you can't buy anything. You can't get drunk.  
Damn. I feel so old. 
He's 20 ... 30 something right?
I don't want to generate five. That's so dumb. I want to other the Five ones up and down. It's so weird. 
"This is how I think. Do, re, mi, do, re, mi, do, re, fuck me. "
Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Children. 
Yes. It's one of my favorite words. It is my favorite word. 
It's so versatile. 
"You can use it anytime, bad, good. Fuck yeah. Fuck no. "
Any fucking situation. Fucking kind of works. 
There's emphasis. 
Use it as a literal word. I Was fucking. 
"You can go, ""Fuck man. I was fucking so many fucking bitches that ..."" I don't know. There's more fucks you could use. "
No you. 
No I am. That's the sad part. 
Saturday is the day. 
"I'm working until 3, 3:30. "
 I told them I couldn't work after 3:30. 
"Must be nice, must be nice. "
Maybe we could just do it Thursday instead. Just bring our alcohol in class. 
"Professor, if you're listening to this, would you care to join us? "
Or just get a bottle of Windex and some blue Gatorade. 
Put some bleach and just put water in it. 
You drink the bleach. Clean it with bleach and then drink the bleach.
Bleach is really healthy for you. It kills all your germs out. 
Hey we should Chris-
We should invite Chris and Sarah. 
I'm looking at these zeros.  
If you want ....
Hey Sarah. What are you doing this Friday?
Or we could be the pregame. 
We're going to try and get Jeff Cote to come but we'll see. 
He seems like a Christian man that doesn't like to partake. 
In the alcoholic ...
How are we supposed to start this because the writing on there is too small.
I need to know for me.
I don't feel like moving.
They're behind. 
How do you generate a random number from zero to nine? Zero to eight. 
Oh my God. 
384109272
Wow. That worked way better than I expected it. So I've got my column generator. 
That's right. 
Why do you type like not an old lady? It's so much better. 
These dang gone computer machinery things. They're so complicated. 
Why can't I just put my punch card in the machine and have it output the calculations?
I've got seven billion discord notifications. What is going on? Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. 
The XY. 
Fair enough. Yeah. 
That's pretty pointless. 
"Now, I got to eat. "
My brain hurts. 
Oh shit. That's not nice. 
I have half a brain. 
I need one brain cell. 
You made it this far. 
That's a hard working cell. 
"Yeah dude. I just take creatine every morning. I just get a funnel, I'll put some creatine in there and it pumps out brain all day. "
That's how my other cells died. They couldn't handle it. 
But he's like brain dead. 
What the hell did you just do?
Bag of dicks. 
I don't want one of those. 
Hey Mr. Jeff Cote. 
I know how to generate a random column. Put the one in but I can't import my rows from my other ring. That loops putting a zero in each position. I can't do that here because row is specifically for here. 
Do I just do another loop to put it in rows?
This is just testing to see if the actually works. I'm going to fix it to make sure it only puts it in certain rows. 
Is it I?
Okay. 
Should I put five ones in there?
Vertically. 
That one? It's not showing up. What? Whoa. Whoa. Great. 
It does? 
That's cool. 
What?
We've got a major dilemma here. 
We've got a major dilemma.
We got a shit load of ones. 
I am so lazy. 
He hasn't even done his assignment. 
Yes. 
I've never had a watermelon flavor. 
Let me get one of those. 
Hm-mm-hmm (affirmative). 
"Damn, those are tasty. "
I appreciate your generosity. 
"I'm already there. Send me the address, I'm walking there. "
I guess we'll find that out tomorrow. 
I've got a loser so far. 
He almost won. he was one one way. 
I'm going to fix it. 
Professor? I have a question. 
So I've generated the slot machine to drain the five ones. But I don't know how to increment it  
"Where should my press enter go in this loop? Should it go just before this, right here? "
So it's after you print the actual aray but before you can go to the next line?
is just your formatting because we're actually printing out a space. 
Press enter. 
Should I just make it a string?
Dot next. Then they just press enter? 
"Oh, it's next line?  "
Then that should do it. Press enter. Well it's doing that. 
That should solve at least one line. Prints five times. 
Because it's inside this loop. 
So it needs to come. 
This is printing the aray. The aray is defaulting to zeros. So you don't need to put anything in the aray at all. 
"This just prints it. When you make a five by nine two dimensional aray, it just fills it with zeros. "
This is printing each of the zeros. 
So what is the display for?
this program right here is printing this. 
Okay. That makes sense. 
"I have no idea what she said to me. Hey, I'm wired up. "
Can I just make a wild loop? That makes this way easier. 
While your counter's less than five just keep pressing enter. 
This sucks. 
I don't know what I'm doing. 
Why not just make five arrays and then ... I can just make five arrays. 
It just shows plus enter. 
"Oh my God, that's just cheating. "
Let me see that?
Wait. Dude. You have it so easy. Look. 
Do not rely right now. 
Oops. That's not the main aray. 
Wow. That was so easy. I just fixed it for you. 
"God, it took two lines. "
Just say you lose every time because the probability is so low. It's literally impossible. Let's do that exit form before we forget. 
"I have done it like, two days after class sometimes. "
You did it again. 
Just do it outside . Just do it outside the loop. 
What interesting concept did you learn today? Gambling is bad. 
"Bang, bang, bang. "
We should just turn that in. 
I feel positive in our neutral. 
Change. War. War never changes. 
What?
Yeah it's done. 
"Oh, Andrew. You know what you can do? You can do a random number generator from zero to 100. Make the number two the winning number. One in 100 chance to say you won. "
33%. 
It's almost impossible to win. 
But how do we make it align?
Would I just Google how to check if columns an aray?
This is impossibrew. 
"Oh, you know what you can do? You can make."
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Hey Andrew. You can make nine aray-"
I know. I'm sorry. 
You can make nine different arrays. Each of them with the winning ...
"I know. Isn't that great? You can make nine arrays each with the winning ones and then know check and see if any of the arrays contains the same values. That would work. If it doesn't, then say you lose. "
Suck my butt. 
Creatively vulgar. 
"Dude, I'm probably outline of research. You've got all these productive students talking. Then you've just got me going ... jargon. Where did Chris go? "
All right. Who wants to be productive tomorrow?
Exactly. We can just do this tomorrow. 
"At my old University, at UNCA, I had a philosophy professor who was extremely gender neutral and all about that having on your papers and not saying sexist words I guess. She said we couldn't use the word mankind. We had an argument for like 30 minutes about the definition of mankind. "
"Stop it. Hey, we're still miced up. "
Oh my God. 
"Hey, that looks really good ... doesn't look really good. Never mind. It's fucked up. "
It's fucked up. 
Why is it yellow? Why is it red? Why are numbers red?
"The one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20. "
You can do that? Can I make mine rainbow?
Alternate the colors? That'd be so cool.
Is that how I change my personality?
Right click personality. 
"That'd be so cool if that's how that worked. All right. I'd rather talk about what we're doing Friday than do this code right now. Wow, that's a fat cat. "
Mine id too. I reinstalled it. 
The sum of a column. 
You sum of a column. 
"I love my dad did that to me when I was a kid. I was like, ""Shit."" ""Watch your fucking language Son."""
"But Dad, you just said it. I don't fucking care. I can say what the fuck I want because I'm an adult. Blah, blah, blah. "
What activity is that?
Oh God. I think we did an activity for that.
I gave it some cocaine. 
Close enough. 
It's a heat stick. 
Potatoes because my people had the potato famine once upon a time. 
I love scallions. 
Because you're ginger. 
He's ginger curry. 
I don't know anybody that hates fried chicken except for losers. 
If you don't like fried chicken you're a waste of oxygen. 
"No it's not. What, you think I'm being not serious?"
Okay. I'm not. Not being not serious. So that means I'm being serious. 
"Wait, this is due in four minutes?"
Oh God. Should I just turn in what I have?
That just speaks too deeply to me. 
"Just say, you lose yee master. Ha, ha. "
What was the interesting concept you learned today. MSK would have been better than writing on the white board. 
I don't know how to addiction a column so I'm just going to say you lose every time. What's up? Get yours done?
You know this is when you just chuck it out the window. 
It looks like mine's already been chucked out the window a couple times. 
I was on my skateboard and the laptop just lands on the fucking ground. 
It works though. It's a fucking tank. Until it's not a tank. 
Until it just shits itself and dies. 
"Oh God, it's due. Time to turn them in. Activity 22.java. Choose file. I've got less than 60 seconds. Go, go, go. Submit. Boom. I skirted on that assignment. "
No. We're not finished with the code. But we're finished with this recorder.
