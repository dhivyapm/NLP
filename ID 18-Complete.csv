"Oh yeah, I can imagine. Must be very difficult. Anyways, y'all are good to go. Have fun."
So I started with this.
This is short?
"So if we're using the if statement for a string, do we use stubble quotations?"
If you use the if statement ...
"To check if the user input this, then you ... Should we do it like this?"
I have no idea what I'm doing. [crosstalk 00:23:56].
One. [crosstalk 00:24:01]. Are you still on one too?
I was working on one. [crosstalk 00:24:13].
Square ...
"Okay, I'll try 10. [crosstalk 00:24:49]."
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:30:35].
"The Pokemon [crosstalk 00:31:47]. Yeah, so the Pokemon program is whatever. It was [crosstalk 00:31:54]."
"I mean, actually [crosstalk 00:32:52]."
I don't know why this says this is an error.
Oh. [crosstalk 00:34:54].
Are you almost done with one?
Huh?
Return where?
You did it too?
I'm not really familiar with methods yet.
"If you can, you can drag and drop because [crosstalk 00:36:47]."
"But yes. If you can't drag and drop it, [crosstalk 00:37:23]."
"Feel better now? Okay, awesome."
I think the errors in ... [crosstalk 00:38:18].
Yeah.
Flow chart?
Not yet. [crosstalk 00:40:14].
Okay. [crosstalk 00:40:29].
Yes. [crosstalk 00:41:56].

18
"Oh, sorry."
Oh. 
I still have to do the pseudo code and the flow chart. 
"I didn't use a method, so I should do that."
"Why are you doing it, one?"
Huh?
It is.
What?
Why is there an error input here? There's an error input. 
I don't know why it still gives me an error.
But she says-
The name of the method should be this.
I don't know why... I haven't started the flowchart yet. 
I don't know why this gives an error.
Oh.
I have to do the pseudo code and the flowchart.
I'll send it to you.
Are you done with the second one?
What do you use to draw flow charts?
I think it's going to take me a while to do the flowchart.
How do you do your flowcharts?
"So for the flowcharts, how do you show methods in this?"
Flow charts.
Part one.
Counting vowels.
"Oh, okay."
Bye.
How do I send this?
What?
How do we do that?
This?
I don't know how to send it though.
What?
Save?
18
Sorry.
I don't have a lot of space on my desk.
Did you do 14?
Oh.
Did you do 17?
Yes.
How does it work?
"I don't get it. Yes, the last one."
"For question 15, I didn't fill it completely. Well, I left the last two blank. Did you do question 15?"
15
How do you do 15? 15?
Hey Chris. Chris.
Did you figure out how to do 17?
"Yes, I can't really find selection sort in my head sort."
Is question 11 binary?
Yes.
14 is bubble sort?
14?
Eight is negative 1?
Isn't that a 1?
Oh.
Negative 1?
Nine?
Isn't it negative 1?
Did you say you got 17 wrong?
"Oh, okay."
I don't get question 17 at all.
Sorry.
Did you say this one was wrong?
I don't know how else to find it.
Alright.
27.39 out of 25. I got six wrong.
What?
Should I just keep it like this?
Would you keep it like this?
But-
What was that after the six?
Is that all?
Do you want me to do it again?
Should I do it again?
And I also-
Question 10. Wrong.
It's 10.
"We still have one more attempt, right?"
Are you going to do it again? or not?
Yes.
18
Mine just prints zero.
Yeah.
Here.
"No, I have it here."
What?
What?
Are you done?
Mine is still not printing.
I don't know why I have an error.
"I need to leave in 10 minutes, and I haven't got this done."
"Oh, okay, now it's working."
Huh?
I think I need to do the exit form right now. I have to try it again at home.
Do you have my email?
Thanks.
I think I have to leave now.
Bye.
18
"Oh, sorry."
"Do you think this is okay? I entered the number rows, and columns, and values, 1, 2, 3, 4, and it gives this."
"Um... it says that... ""this cannot be resolved with this variable""?"
"Um, I have a question. There, it says, ""this is between the result of the type and  pressing return AV"", and it ends right here?"
Cast 1 to...?
The print AV to...
"Oh, so like..."
Press return... result of... [crosstalk 00:14:11] 
Thank you.
"Okay, I'm done with 1. Problem 1."
"Um, for problem 1... "
I sent it to you.
"Uh, maybe not today?"
Hi!
Yeah.
"Could you email me, like [crosstalk 00:32:18] part 2? I'm sorry I couldn't stay."
See you tomorrow.
Are you almost done with 2?
"You have my email address, right?"
18
How far did you get?
I have no idea what I am doing.
How do you get it to print five times?
Where should I put the loop?
Isn't that the same thing?
I did exactly what it said.
"But it is still not right, is it?"
Okay.
Not good?
I am trying to do that second part.
I do not think this is going to work though.
Yeah.
Yes.
Are you ready for the test?
I am not ready.
I mean the lab test.
In the method?
Here?
And we would use our input?
Changes again?
You said I had to change this?
I feel like crying.
Do I have to use the four there?
Right?
Thanks.
You do not have time tomorrow.
"You are going to the rock climbing thing tomorrow, right?"
"So, that means you can't study tomorrow?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, a morning class, at eight."
And my brother told me to get a package for him.
And I do not want to.
Huh?
Yeah.
