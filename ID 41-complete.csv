Your number?
41
"I'm going to be an integer today. Keep it simple. You're alone. You walked right into that one. Oh, this is-"
Unless hell opens up.
"Oh, you'll still hear it. If not, we'll just get louder."
"Yeah, it's okay. We've got hours, because we're important."
What did you just say? What did you say?
"See, I keep extra-strength stuff, but I left it at the apartment today. I usually keep it in my bag, too. I keep extra-strength Advil and extra-strength Tylenol. All the time."
That's not bad!
While I'm working?
"I mean the people playing football, you'd be surprised. There were people that I played with that would take 1100 before a game."
"Yeah, it's crazy."
I would wait until half-time to see if I needed it.
But I didn't take it before the game.
Steroids? I would have loved that.
"I mean I've had eyedrops that had steroids in them, but-"
"Of course. I mean, we're getting shit done."
"No, it was really tiny, so I made it bigger. See, now you talked about me, I got to make it small."
You've done enough.
"You're done here, okay? Hey, hey, hey."
All right now.
I think I'd enjoy that. Hasta never!
Yes.
So I did-
"Public static. Do you own a pair of shoes, Tommy?"
Okay.
I'm cool. I worry about [inaudible 00:06:17]
"Ah, she's got that fetish. You wanted in!"
Some people do swimming for one reason [inaudible 00:06:50]
"Get in the pool, ooh!"
You're always in last place! Exactly.
"So we're still on for tomorrow, right? And were we supposed to go to the gym yesterday?"
Did you go?
I completely forgot.
I can hear. I could hear before you took them off.
"Oh, I'm getting out of there. You want to take over my lease? I renewed and I don't want it, cause we're looking for a house now. Yeah. I don't know. That's anywhere you go, you're not going to know about it. You have them on your head."
"Yes. Yes, I did."
"Are we doing upper-case and lower-case letters, or just lower-case?"
But that's not all of them. But what if someone's really angry and they type in all upper-case?
Okay. So we're going to do that first. A dot 2.
You party pooper.
The hardest way possible.
I don't think you can nest switches.
You can? So what is it that can't be nested?
"No, there's something that said that something couldn't be nested. I remember that. I don't read much, but I read some things. I remember reading that something couldn't be nested."
You're going to need your or button. So you're going to have to copy that from somewhere.
"No, he had a great idea. Just, before you go into it, make it all lower-case."
"And then get the letters out of it, at that point."
"Cause it's checking if it's a, if it's e, if it's either one of those letters then it's [inaudible 00:11:44]"
"She did say ASCII code, didn't she? But it automatically-"
"I mean, it'll do the same thing here, so if I take that out and just put the ASCII code for a lower-case a, it would do the same thing."
"This is just a simpler way to write it. A, E, I."
What's tomorrow?
I'm glad you guys know.
"Are we going to do the sometimes y, or no?"
Really? I've got more than that.
"Yeah, you got to pay regardless. I saw that."
"All right. Let's run you out of town. It's got a reference to a non-static. You take...static...okay. See, that's what I was trying to think of, I just couldn't think of the word. No, she said that she said there's only five vowels. A, E, I, O, U. Yeah, she said that she said."
She shells.
Does she have a she shed?
"Input the string. The string has blank vowels. One, two, three, four, five vowels. Enter. Lit. It works."
"Yeah, because you named it a down here. When you pull it in, it's gonna pull it in under that variable."
"It always tells me sudo is spelled wrong. Nope, it's just spelled differently. This is America."
There's like four different ways to spell color.
Color.
"Yeah, he's thirsty."
"No, he's thirsty and the water's not enough. See, now you've got to go fill it up and do it again. Fill it up and do it again! And get me one so we can race! Yeah, that's not fair, that's like an extra 2 or 3 ounces than that."
"Okay, so it's double the size. Nice. More than double, cause that's like 12? 16? 20? 20? Really? Holy shit"
"Yeah, something's wrong with them. They've got pneumonia by the end of that. Their lungs are full of water."
"I don't understand that. I wouldn't try it. I value this life, you know."
"Oh yeah, you got to spin it around a little bit. Either that or cut a whole in the top, or the bottom. The bottom of the top."
We work well together. What? The second one? Well let me get started on it and we'll see what we can do.
"Hey man, hey. This is teamwork. Fucking shit, I hate this. No, every time I try to go to new and then class, my cursor goes a little too high and the new disappears."
I like to test it while I'm working.
Do you use notepad? Or notepad++?
I love plus plus.
"So you never have to change the class, is what you're saying?"
"Makes sense, makes sense."
"That's why you guys are partners, okay? We get it. It's fine."
Yes.
Cause that's-
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Well, no. You're increasing your i. So your i is just your counter to keep the loop going. Your vowels is how you're actually counting the vowels."
Yes.
Sub-string.
Sub-string. Where's my cookie?
"[crosstalk 00:20:12] Cause he doesn't want to damage his screen, come on now."
So that's inside of the if.
"Yes, it's a nested. Problem 2....Problem dos. Underscore."
We're not allowed to use it.
"I will not, uh-uh. I like my insides to stay inside. I won't be attempting any splits, ever."
"Yeah, cause you're checking the character at the index of the counter."
I did the same thing for Assignment 2. I did everything checking this way.
You have to do two flow-charts?
"He got it done while we were doing the [inaudible 00:21:48] he was multitasking, he's got two keyboards so he just kinda...."
I'm a set mine back up again. I liked having that.
Yeah. For every-
You don't have to.
Cause it's already in that big parentheses. So it's got that one-
"No, this one in front of A? That's going to be the big parentheses."
Yep. And then or.
And then all of that again just with E.
"With that, you just got to have it start somewhere else. You can have it start somewhere else."
Let me see what you got.
"I love the visuals, it's amazing."
"No, no, no. It said we can't use split."
That's not in the instructions. I'm sorry.
The instructions...specifically. Specifily.
"It's raining outside, guys."
Huh?
But she's not here today. We have to have a fall-back.
I'm going to a different slide.
We can't use dot sub-string.
It says we can't use split. But it doesn't say anything about-
Ah.
So you want us to use a separate method? Can we use a split or that sub-string inside the method?
Each word?
I did.
I just did if.
"It's a little bit, yeah. I enjoyed thinking outside the box. Has it been 30 hours again?"
"Well, can we get an explanation in five minutes?"
"I want to try it first, and then she can come give us the answer."
"I didn't try it with upper-case, to be completely honest. Yeah, it doesn't work."
I don't want to.
"It's bad because I kept deleting something I didn't want to. Yeah, I don't know, it's not working. I don't care about the upper-case. Yeah, it's not working for the upper-case, so I'm just going to forget about it."
"Control, shift... what does it do?"
"Nah, like, I wanna get this done, guys, why are you all quitting on me?"
"We're just not ready to do anything, and let you do it. [inaudible 00:32:22]"
You know I can see what you're listening to on Spotify? [crosstalk 00:32:42]
"I can see what he's listening to, I can't see what you're listening to."
"Oh wow, nah, it's not the same person."
We're still recording.
It's okay. We'll get there.
"Oh, I don't have an IDE open anywhere. Fuck. This is gonna be like ten minutes!"
[crosstalk 00:55:24]
"Yeah, dude."
"Man, that sucks."
"I'm ready to make an array. Where there's a will, there's an array."
"Where there's a will, there's array."
Wash your mouth with soap.
"In my country, we wash mouth with soap."
You're not being recorded.
Everything is awesome.
Let's not do that.
[crosstalk 00:57:37] passive aggressive if you guys do that.
I said I might end up passive aggressive if you do that.
"Alright, this is activity 17."
"Where there's a will, there's array."
"Random. Oh, we get to use math.random again, look at that."
What goes up must come down.
Yeah. You didn't know that?
It's a good thing we didn't play the telephone game in this classroom.
"Yeah, you really should not have eaten those Nerds."
Diabetes is a side effect.
Diabetes. [inaudible 00:59:18]
How many problems are there?
How do you not know... it's in the book!
You guys clearly didn't do the pre-work.
[inaudible 01:00:06] So of course first we're gonna import because that's what we do all the time.
"And then you do open, close square brackets. Of course, this is Java."
That was a really good one.
"First, I'm not a boy. I am a man. No, what'd you ask? Yes."
"I am so Confucius. My middle name is philosophy, okay?"
"My middle name? That's how I work, yeah."
"Hey. It's not stupid, you are."
"It's not stupid, you are."
"That was not nice, I apologize."
"You didn't do the pre-work, did you?"
"I love you guys, you guys are awesome, that's why we're friends."
With a user defined size.
You didn't figure it out.
"Welcome to 5th Grade, how you doing?"
It's for.
No he doesn't name it.
Just giving the size.
Come on. You haven't done anything?
You need to know it. Random between zero and nine. Size. All right. Let's do this.
[crosstalk 01:04:36] size. And dot next. You piece of fuck. You forgot how to make a random number.
Size equals N dot next N.
You got to do a four loop.
Yeah. Because it's in the book.
In the book it's to print out all of it. Let's see if I can find it again. Yeah. That's the wrong one. Yeah. I'd like to see that one though.
"Here we go. The following loop assigns zero to the first one, one to the second one. So we'll use four INTI equals blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Got it?"
So what this does is it's going to loop through.
Yeah. This is the array.
Because you'll get the user input first and then-
"Make it into ... so, the reason ..."
I'm going to declare my array after. Yeah.
So I'm going to declare my array after I get the user input.
Where the hell did that come from?
All right.
INT. Array.
"Bracket, bracket."
Okay. Hold on. Wow.
Oh man.
No don't do that. That's not nice.
So this is [crosstalk 01:08:40]. This is declaring the array and then this is initializing it. So this just makes it.
Now it knows it's got.
It's got 50 spaces that need to be filled up or have made they put in.
You have to do that INT bracket in front of it. Whatever that's called.
There we go. You got to cast it. Like a mold.
What do you need help with? You need to have a ...
Do you at least have the array? No. Okay. Hold on.
It's math. Well let me do the random first. INT random. Random equals math dot random bitch. Times ...
Yeah. Max minus min.
It's plus one yeah.
"It's nine minus zero, yeah. 10 and then it's plus the minimum which is zero. Okay. So yeah, that works. [crosstalk 01:11:06]."
It's not that bad.
"Hey, hey. Every thing is awesome. [crosstalk 01:11:41]."
Four INTI.
Four zero.
I less than ... shit. Array.
Yeah.
Yes ma'am. It is a control variable. Less length. I have gotten very far. [crosstalk 01:13:04]. See. I'm still helpful. Trying to downplay my work. [crosstalk 01:13:16]. Everything is awesome.
Equals ... Shit.
No I got to move that.
"Hey, hey."
Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable.
What was his name? Did he have a name?
It wasn't skrat was it? No that's something else.
He had like a person's name.
Rufus.
It was Rufus.
Yeah he does. Are we going to print this out? Ah we're going to do a lot of shit.
Value.
By showing. Which means we do have to print it.
No just the value of the maximum. So does anybody know how to find the maximum? Yes. No. Maybe?
So so. [foreign language 01:15:09].
So this is going to say array index of. It'll start at the first index is zero. It'll put a random number in.
Hm-mm-hmm (affirmative).
Yeah.
Everything is awesome. [foreign language 01:16:18] I've already got it filled. I just need to get it ... the other stuff. [foreign language 01:16:24].
We got to find the index and ...
The value of the maximum. Let's see if it's in the book.
It's in the book. Page 250. Finding the largest element.
Really?
Yeah I saw that.
Ah it's another loop. Fuck.
Yeah the largest.
That's in the book too. [crosstalk 01:17:32]. No this is a lot that we're going to have to remember.
"It's going to update if it's greater than ... because we initialize it as at the first index. It's checking if it's greater than the other one. If it's greater than what we already have. It if is, it'll update it. If not, if will just keep going. [crosstalk 01:18:16]. Why did that not work the way it's supposed to. Did I spell it wrong? ARR. Why not? What the fuck did I do wrong? What the hell? Maybe if I just try."
Yeah but I've got everything as an N.
No it said it couldn't find it.
Oh that's because it's ... I did a down here that's why. It's not declared until down there. So I'll just do it down here. Asshole.
Four INTI.
Five's greater than ... [foreign languange 01:19:37]. Five is less than array. Oh wow it's less than array dot [inaudible 01:19:52]. Array I. Greater than ... [crosstalk 01:19:52].
What is that?
After. Put it in the four loop it'll print a bunch of different times.
"The max. That's not it though, we got to find ..."
You got to print the ...
you have to print the value and the index. So where it's at.
The index is going to be your I value. [crosstalk 01:22:18].
What. What happened? [crosstalk 01:22:29]. Oh you can't use the I value because it's inside the loop
No hold on. Put your hand down. All we got to do is use a different ... instead of declaring it. Look. Hold on. Wait. Don't tell them anything. No. No. Listen to me. Listen here bucko. Jesus. Don't speak. Jesus. You're not listening. I am trying to do the flipped classroom. [crosstalk 01:23:49].
Listen to me.
Yeah you idiot. Why'd you put it in the loop?
Hey. Hey. No. No. No. [foreign language 01:26:12].
Use your noggin. Dude.
You might have to ... well you'll just put the ...
How are you print it? In a loop?
Can I see it?
You just put a ... Well you don't even have to do it all separately. Put it after that K. Go next to the K. Do print plus quotes. [foreign language 01:27:48].
"Mine ain't working yet, let me see that."
I don't think my random is working.
Mine runs it's just not doing what I need it to do.
I thought you already took that? Fucker. Oh that sucks. I got it. So it's the parenthesis.
It's the parenthesis that I had to do right.
Go ahead and run it. [crosstalk 01:29:54].
Index out of bounds.
Out of bounds.
Where did you ... which on is that? Is that?
That's your max. Okay. Index equals one.
That one down there.
The second one. That's not supposed to be there. So where you have four index equals one semicolon one one.
Go up.
It's the four statement. That second one.
Yeah. My random wasn't working.
It's the parenthesis that are fucked up. I went ahead and just did everything. I Did 10 minus zero and then plus one. [crosstalk 01:31:14].
Yup. Looks like it's working. It's just weird that it's always at the last index isn't it? [crosstalk 01:31:38]. It's always at the last one.
Let's see if mine's doing that. I don't know. It might be. It sure is.
"The only issue I'm having right now is it's printing, it's always printing the last index. I'm not sure if the max value .."
Yeah.
Well I don't know if it is but it's always showing the last index.
According to the last index.
I think the random part's working.
It's the [crosstalk 01:33:51]
I can't hear it.
In this [inaudible 01:33:51]
"Okay, so the random's not working. Not at all."
It's just going [crosstalk 01:34:26]
It's because I did it up here. Yeah. I need to put that down here. That's what it is.
"It's doing it every time. Right now, it's got a random value and it's using that same [crosstalk 01:34:50]"
Yeah.
"I had that issue before, and I should have known."
That'll do it.
"I'll still declare it up there, but I'll initialize it down here."
Just in case we have to use it somewhere else.
"Yeah, but 10? One, two, three, four ... What the hell?"
"One, two, three ... All right, let's give it the benefit of the doubt. The fuck kind of shit, dude? Ridiculous."
Ridonculous.
"Yeah, and the index is still wrong. Seven might be the right one, but it's-"
"You've got a size of ... What was your size? Five? It only printed one, two, three, four. That's because the first one is five. The index zero, because that's what it started at. Right?"
What are you saying? No. The size isn't an index. The size is how many there literally are. When you go from-
"There should be five of them there, but there's not because the first one isn't going to print."
Yeah.
"In that loop, the first one's never going to print."
We'd have to do that up here [crosstalk 01:37:49]
"Yeah, so I'm going to have it print the first one."
Because we don't take Ls. Okay?
"Fucking piece of shit, dude."
"The index is still wrong. I know why it's doing it, I just don't know how to fix it yet."
Yeah.
...of that value?
Once it goes through the If statement?
But it has to check all of them. [crosstalk 01:40:22] It's going to go to the end of the list. Huh?
"What we can do is do a max index value and do what you're saying, because I think you're right."
Max.
"That's why. Shit, I can't get that out. I have to declare you."
What? Mother fucker.
Local variable may not have been initialized.
"No. It doesn't know what to do with it because there's nothing in it, so I'm going to tell it that it starts at zero. Try this bitch again. [inaudible 01:42:12] at index nine. Okay."
Too many. I don't feel like counting that.
"There is no index eight, you piece of shit."
"Oh, that's why. I don't need the array index. I need the index. Fucking idiot."
"One, two, three, four. Zero, one, two, three, four. Yes, bitch! Ha! Zero, one, two, three, four. Yes, sir. It works. We did it."
Yeah.
"That's why we've got four eyes on this. Four eyes, two brains."
What if it's an upper case L?
No?
With a finger and a thumb in the shape of L on her forehead.
"It did, and that's only the second part of the fucking ..."
"What's up, man?"
"Okay, Charlie. Let's do Charlie."
"Actually, let's not do Charlie because I'm straight and ..."
"It could, but ..."
I've never met a female Charlie.
I haven't.
"[crosstalk 01:44:45] I think that's where my obsession with masculine names given to females started. It's even better when they're extremely feminine and their name is, I don't know, Charlie. That's the best."
Calculate the average of all the array elements.
"Random shuffling, shifting."
"Yeah, it's going to be another loop. I think it's all going to be loops."
"We're going to have to add them all up, and then divide by how many there are."
"Yes, divide by the size. Let's do another four. Do the same four we did before. Five equals zero. I is less than ..."
I love it. Every time your screen falls over it's awesome.
"Yeah, it does."
[inaudible 01:47:23] to sum equals array I.
Plus equals ... But we're going to have to initialize.
Yeah. Shit.
I don't need the sum to print. We need the average.
"I'm just going to use it in here. Well, shit. Yeah, I am going to need that outside of the loop. You're saving me minutes. I love it."
[crosstalk 01:48:31] sum.
Sum equals zero. Sum plus equals array. Array I.
"That's going to add them all up right there. Then, we can come outside of the four loop and take ... We'll do INT average equals sum divided by-"
Array dot link.
"Then print that out. Well, fuck it."
I can't declare it in the print. Fuck. Bitch.
"Five, four, six, three. That's why [crosstalk 01:50:12] You idiot."
Shit. What?
"What the fuck is going on? Type that, you piece of corn."
Let's try this one more time. I'm going to type exactly what I just typed.
It's talking about the operator less than or equal to. I didn't type less than or equal to. That's nowhere on my screen.
"My friends tell me I drink too much, but I don't think so. You know? I think I handle myself pretty well. No, I'm fucking with you. I don't drink that much."
[crosstalk 01:52:40] buy an 18 pack a week. That's all.
I think I know what I did wrong. Piece of fuck. I just deleted all of that.
"Yeah, I think I typed the system dot print inside the system dot print."
"Are you all done, sir?"
"Yeah, pretty much. I have to part E and F."
I got D done.
It's not very easy.
I know that.
Says who?
Where does it say that?
"See, I just didn't ..."
I just didn't read that far.
"Nine plus three is 12, plus eight is 20, plus four is 24."
24 divided by four ... Yeah. That's it.
"There's a lot of parts to this. See, they make us think it's not a lot of work, by making it one problem."
You said E? We got to finish D first.
"Look, we just got in the tunnel. We can't be looking for the light."
"Yeah, we're halfway through-"
...with an empty tank of gas.
"I got to do comments, so I know what the heck I'm looking at."
Three size input.
Watch that be way more complicated than a loop.
All the slots don't have to be full.
Uh uh.
People with one car buy houses with three car garages.
What? You use a garage to store shit.
No.
Of course you can.
We just haven't gotten that far yet.
Don't be afraid.
Be very afraid.
The loop.
That's the people that come around knock on your door.
Threaten to kill you.
They threaten to kill you if you don't pay up.
At all values of array ...
Yeah. C++ is much better.
"No, it is not."
The words are shorter.
C++ is not hard at all.
"Instead of typing System dot Out dot Print Line, in C++ it's C Out."
"To get something from the user, it's C In."
"No, it is not. It's the letter C and I-N."
You might be gay. I don't know.
Values of [crosstalk 01:59:19]
"Look, it's not a flying fuck. It's a flying saucer full of fucks. Okay? [inaudible 01:59:26]"
Determine [crosstalk 01:59:32]
What's you going to do at home?
You're not going to do the work. Might as well stay home and get it done.
You can't do it here? Huh? [crosstalk 01:59:43] We too good for you?
Aww. I'm sorry. [crosstalk 01:59:48] Aww. Burn.
"I got a membership to Planet Fitness. [crosstalk 01:59:59] No, Planet Fitness."
I got a membership.
I got a black card.
There's a Planet Fitness right down here.
A little further down University-
... Boulevard.
I drive.
But I drive.
"All right. No, because I'm in University Crossings."
I just drive down to the gym.
Uh uh. But you said it's right next to ...
Yeah.
"Oh, okay."
I ride my bike.
I don't have a parking pass.
That's why I wanted to be so close because I didn't want a parking pass.
Yeah.
It's still too much.
That would've been real nice.
"...like, ""Shut the fuck up!"" e sort of chanting going on in the library. I'm like, ""Are you kidding me right now?"""
Can you imagine if there was something going on like that here?
At Burger King?
"Yeah, we see you."
I've got a test tomorrow.
You've got to avoid stressors.
I can't avoid work [crosstalk 02:03:56] so I drink instead.
"Oh, man."
I need to go there.
"[crosstalk 02:04:50] I think that's a little ... It's gotta be. If it's not descendants, then they're doing too much."
That's not cool at all.
"'cause I'm here, paying for my education, but you're paying for something you did."
Long time ago.
That's nothing- [crosstalk 02:05:12] that has nothing to do with me.
I wasn't alive!
(laughing).
I don't think there's a time that's not confusing.
Alright.
"No, we're gonna have a next class."
Touche`.
I don't know.
"I kinda show up, and disappear. This shouldn't be too hard. For them, it's a higher values than the average, alright. This is gonna be another loop."
"(whispering) Holy fuck! Okay, let's think about this."
Okay.
"Yeah, I don't think we need three loops."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Find the [inaudible 02:06:57] that have higher values than the average. So it's gonna be the same ""for"" loop."
Start at zero.
"You wanna check all of 'em. ""For"" INTI equals zero. I is less than array ..."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
I don't need it.
Cookout is comfort food.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
To talk about race.
Woosah.
"So, we're going through the array, one by one. And this is where we have the ""if"" statement. If ... if array ... index, or I."
Greater than average. Then ... we are going to ...
"Copy them into a new array, named High Values."
"So first, you gotta create the array. So let's go outside of the ""for"" loop, [crosstalk 02:09:05] and create the array."
INT ... I Values ...
You have to initialize it.
Yeah. New ... let's see if I can get this right. New INT ... New High Values ... No.
"Fuck, I can't remember. INT array equals New INT size. Okay."
Yeah.
Yes.
"But it's gonna always go into the same ... Well, we can put it into the same index, 'cause it's gonna be the same size."
So we can do ... How do we put it in?
Array I ... equals ... Not array I. [crosstalk 02:10:56] It'll be High Values.
"Equals ... array I. So that we'll get the number that's actually in there, not just the index."
"'cause if we just do I, then it would give us the index of that high value, but it won't give us the value of that number."
"So what this is gonna do, it's gonna go through an ""if."""
"Yeah. So ""if we use these numbers, ""if"" index one ... Well let's see. [crosstalk 02:11:48] Average is six. So index zero will be greater than the average, and the high value zero, since we're still at zero ..."
Nine. And then go again.
Reach eight.
And then it'll be at index zero one two.
Greater than average. So the index is gonna be two. Your array is gonna be eight. So we're gonna have empty space.
Yeah. (laughing).
"Who was sitting next to us? Um, his last name is Scallion. Chase. There we go."
Yeah.
"Yeah, Toby, that's an easy one. Nicotine, let's see if I can figure that."
I've got him on Snapchat.
"To ask, yeah."
It's like that sometimes.
I think it's ... Might be Isaiah.
"'cause there's Toby, Isaiah, Eber ... I don't know who Eber is."
"Okay. And then Emily, that's the girl that sits there."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
(laughing).
"Name your high values. So I guess after all of that, we can print High Values. And I'll do that in the ""for"" loop, not in the ""if"" loop."
Just to check it.
I don't know.
"It'll print. So it'll update it, and then it'll come up here again, and it'll print it."
But we can do it afterwards too.
"Either way, I think, would work. But it might be better this way."
Print line ... High Values ... high values I ...
"Yeah. That works. Next value's nine, at index one. It sure is, but there's two nines, and I don't get how. The average is five, okay. And nine and nine are greater than the average. See? We did that with one loop."
"Well, if it's in a loop."
"It is technically a loop. It's an ""if"" loop."
Yeah.
"If is a baby loop. ""For"" is a actual loop."
"If is a loop, just 'cause somebody said it was. Part ... E, echo."
"I'm doing it just for my sanity, 'cause I wouldn't know where one thing ends, and one thing begins."
"And if I wanna go back and say, ""Oh, we did something that we can use, before,"" I'm like, ""Okay, now I gotta look through all that ..."""
Yeah. So this one is ... woo!
Declare new array. High values. And he had help.
He said he used three loops. He had help.
That says a lot.
"Part E, shuffle all to the elements up to [inaudible 02:17:12]. Do not have to shuffle space and just re-randomize the values. This is going to kill me."
Okay.
Can't we use a loop for this?
"I feel ... Let's see if there's anything in the book. I feel like I ... Yeah, random shuffling."
"Randomly re-order the elements. I know that. This is called shuffling. For each element, randomly generate an index, and swap I with J as follows. For INTI equals array, that length minus one. Minus one?"
Fuck it.
I is greater than zero. I minus minus. Generate the index randomly with zero ... J mapped at random. Times ...
Not sure I understand that.
"Oh, I didn't know she was still here."
"Zero, one, J, I."
"Oh, the random number has to be between ..."
"It's less. Zero less than or equal to J, less than or equal to I. J has to be less than, J has to be greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to the length, basically."
"Okay. I understand it now. So what you're doing is, for every ... INTI ... [crosstalk 02:20:04] This is all of the indexes. Yeah. This is all of the indexes. So, for a list of 50, this will be 49, 'cause the index starts at zero."
"So, 49. And then while it's greater than zero, 'cause we're working our way backwards."
"Go ... INTJ, get a random number that is between ..."
It's getting a random index number.
"And then it's gonna swap the ... I don't know why they're using a temp. Well, I do know why they're using a temp. They're gonna swap those two index numbers, basically. 'cause we'll take a temp, put I in the temp. And then, put J into I. And then put I back into J. Okay. That makes sense."
You got it?
"Yeah, we gotta make it, just to hold it."
'cause if you ...
"... put something on top of it, then the first number disappears."
"Alright, so it all makes sense."
"For INTI ... equals ... all of the indexes. So, array dot length, minus one."
"While I is greater than zero ... then we're going to work our way backwards. I minus minus. Bracket bracket. So we're gonna get a random number, a random index. So it'll be INT. I'm just going to use ... I don't like all this I, J bullshit. Random integer, random index, so I know what the fuck I'm doing."
Yeah. I gotta know what's going on. Random index equals ... we got a typecast INT mapped at random.
Yes. We are.
You can-
(MISSING AUDIO FROM 00:19:15 UNTIL 00:29:12)
41
Zero.
"Zero, two and three. One going back into A, so A is going to be one."
Was not returned. So A is still ten.
"So, for four, A is still gonna be ten. Zero-"
No.
I mean its-
"Yeah, so it's gonna update."
'Cause Javas an asshole like that and they wanna confuse everybody that writes it.
It's got really big eyes. It can see a little further. I don't know.
"Yeah, so five is false, but six is true. Wait?"
"I don't know if it's true for all objects, but-"
'Cause I saw it somewhere. Honestly.
More power to you. [crosstalk 02:39:49]. Oh shit.
I feel like I'm in a bowl of spaghetti. All this stuff around me.
"Yeah, I got this going, that going."
"I have to plug this into this. Too much, way too much going on."
"This one, next to your feet?"
I don't know my power save came with one.
Yeah. It's a little power hungry.
So what'd you learn? Share with us?
Bet. I love it. Give this boy a raise.
Let's just chalk it up as Java sucks and get on with it.
Wait what's seven?
"11, space, five. [crosstalk 02:42:47]. So it's one T one, space, five. Is that right?"
"One T one. What the fuck is 11? One T one. Guys it's one T one. I don't know where y'all get this weird language y'all are speaking but, 11, what the hell?"
Aerodynamics are all on that. You missed by a mile.
"Seven is one T one, space, five. It's one T one, space five."
"Yeah. One T one, space, five."
Everything is awesome. [crosstalk 02:44:09]. It's still stuck in my head.
David slip again? [crosstalk 02:44:27].
I didn't hear a word you just said. [crosstalk 02:44:57].
I'm still looking at question nine.
I'm just gonna go change off.oh thats easy.
"So what, what does one do?"
Yeah.
Of course.
Would you like a couple jolly ranchers too? No? Am I the only one here that likes jolly ranchers?
"Green apple, yeah."
"Well, did I tell you when we used to make jungle juice?"
"We used to make jungle juice in a big, giant, one of those tupper ware things that you put clothes in."
That's okay.
That's okay.
"No, we used to put all of that [crosstalk 02:47:09] we put all the alcohol, sprites, juices, and then we dump-"
Then we would dump two pounds of jolly ranchers in there and let it dissolve everything.
What're you talking about?
Really?
Jungle juice isn't supposed to have a flavor.
It's supposed to be dangerous.
"Yeah well you see, I just drink it so that I pass out. I just drink to have fun."
What do you usually drink for?
So basically.
That's all I need.
"I'm good, that's all I need. Did you get this?"
Question one? There it goes.
"Yeah, reference and same."
What?
Of an infant? [crosstalk 02:49:27].
"Well, I'll stay away from that one."
"I'm glad we know more about alcohol than we do about Java. [crosstalk 02:50:00]. Beautiful, awesome. [crosstalk 02:50:01]."
And then you'll be asked for the-
Activation code for windows.
Which one? The Reese's or the jolly ranchers?
Jolly ranchers. You want one?
What is it?
"Four people, that's it?"
"That's all, just four people?"
One of those [inaudible 02:51:21] things. [crosstalk 02:51:22].
Yep. I'm not getting' any of it. So we've gotta make a string array.
Get 10 names from the user.
Search it. [crosstalk 02:51:50].
"Alright guys, are you ready to do this?"
"Yeah, it's disgusting."
It's not good. [crosstalk 02:53:54]. We made ginger ale in high school [crosstalk 02:53:57]. I've never done that.
"Made ginger ale in high school once and of course ... no, I love ginger ale but of course some of us wanted to taste the ginger so [crosstalk 02:54:07]."
Yeah. [crosstalk 02:55:06].
I don't know anything about.
Well the first thing that comes to mind for me is Monks.
"Monks? Yeah, that's about it."
Is it suffering or is the-
"Yeah, no material things."
It's due at 8;15 and it's like [crosstalk 02:56:47].
[inaudible 02:56:54]. Don't remember it.
"Hey, where you going?"
"We gotta make a string array, put 10 names in it, and then search it-"
"Yeah, just that one."
Something to do [crosstalk 02:59:02].
Oh.
Yoga?
I enjoy yoga.

We're inmates.
Inmate 0042.
We're all wired.
"Shit, shit. Shit. [crosstalk 00:00:59] Shit. God."
Process of looking for a specific element. I feel like that could be so many different words. Search. Searching is a process of looking for a specific element?
"I'm just thinking of stuff. I mean, it could be any number of things. I'm going to say search. And we'll see how that goes."
Searching is the process of looking for a specific element [inaudible 00:01:41]. Works for me.
Oh no.
"Well, no, because eventually they have to roll it back up later."
Three is linear.
So we're going to go with sequential?
Search? I'm just going to do searching.
Capital S.
"Look, man. This is not English."
Yeah. And then linear and binary. And then linear again.
Let's say [inaudible 00:02:58] looks like this. [inaudible 00:02:59] going mainstream arguments.
"We just did this, didn't we?"
"Hold on, now."
"Mystery, oh we got to look back up."
[crosstalk 00:03:43] it looks like this. Starting with eight. [crosstalk 00:03:48]
Is eight in there? Eight's not in there. Okay. Cool. [crosstalk 00:04:06]
Now we're looking for six. Six is... Three. Right.
"No, I don't think so, no."
Slow your horses.
It can if I shoot him in the leg. [crosstalk 00:04:42]
What does this perform? [crosstalk 00:04:52]
No idea.
Yes. No.
Six is three. Seven.
Binary?
You move fast.
Why did you get the answer above?
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's going to return the index of it. [crosstalk 00:05:44]"
"Where did it go? Searching stuff, mystery [inaudible 00:05:54]."
What is?
Okay.[crosstalk 00:06:05]
"What about [inaudible 00:06:19]. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Binary. [crosstalk 00:06:21]"
What the fuck does this even mean?
"Step one, I mean..."
What am I supposed to get from question-
"Because six is at index one, so that index of one is what's returned."
Yeah.
"Oh, hey."
Choose the correct process for each step?
"I mean, where the hell is step one?"
Hey guys. Hey group.
"Group? Group? Hey, group."
People.
What the fuck is question 10 asking me?
For question 10?
Eight? What?
How is it wrong?
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
"I mean, this has-"
"Oh well, yeah, because it's even there's..."
The middle would be three.
Mystery method. Where does mystery method start at?
Did you guys use the mystery method?
Somebody give me something to smoke.
We can go to the apartment if we really want to. I've got a nice little toy to play with.
"Oh no, I've got a nice little-"
I've got a bowl. I just bought a bowl because I don't know how to roll.
"Well now that I have the bowl, I don't really need to."
"I've been smoking for years, but I've always been around people that rolled for me."
So I never had to learn.
Yeah. It's crazy.
Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Can't beat that.
Taught him how to break it down.
It'll be legal by then.
He's going to be so sad. Or he's going to get arrested.
Yeah. I know.
What is question 10 asking us?
We're doing that. Okay.
Y'all are so sensitive.
Yep. Inmate number. I forgot already. 40? I'm 40?
So I'm 41.
Okay so I'm inmate 41.
Government name is Jim Bob Billy Bob.
Joe.
Jim Bob Billy Bob Joe.
Don't forget the Joe.
Yeah.
So it's Joe Jim Bob Billy Bob.
Friends just call me J.
That's-
I'm going strictly time.
I'm going strictly time.
"I really need to go ahead and do it, but I haven't, so-"
I need to talk to my advisor.
What the fuck?
Whoa. I can't grip it.
He's got three of them.
It was in the vending machine in Fretwell.
That's our jobs. Collectively.
Yes.
So eight just changed? Eight is negative one. [crosstalk 00:15:44]
"So that means nine has to change, guys."
We've scared them away.
Do it. [crosstalk 00:16:30]
Can we just close this and-
... hot box the room? [crosstalk 00:16:38]
Have you not seen-
Have you not seen Neighbors?
"Have you not see Neighbors? What was it, the second one? Where they [crosstalk 00:17:02]."
"It's the number after nine, before 11."
It's what she was doing up there before. So we have to go through every step.
Would you like a peanut butter cup?
"I mean, you got to work your way up."
"Wait, did you all just get 10? Is that what we're doing here?"
You're stuck on lucky number 13?
"I've seen it before, but-"
"I used to know, but I don't know anymore."
Oh because it starts in small groups at a time.
Or you can just counterfeit the passes and-
But then they... Six figures may be seven figures to them.
"Go, go, go, go, go."
I've played football. [crosstalk 00:19:44]
"Assuming an array is already sorted, which search method is more efficient for finding the element in an array?"
I was an outside linebacker.
"But an outside linebacker is more, at least these days, is more like a down safety, so..."
"That's what I want to go to. I want to go back. Like if I start playing here, I'm going to running back. And I'm going to be running through people like..."
Yeah. And I can't gain weight for anything. I've tried.
"Yeah, it's impossible."
"So, 11?"
"Oh, I'm saying."
"Binary? I mean, we get three chances."
I don't know if it will. It probably won't.
"I believe your statistics, but we won't learn anything that way."
Because that's what's in the book and the book is supposed to be correct.
"I don't know, I'm on 12."
The smallest number?
Drops it with the first number. Yeah. Because that's what she did earlier.
Then it's done.
You're a bubble sort.
That is very uncomfortable.
We call that prolapse.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
We're not supposed to know we're [inaudible 00:22:17] we wear that. That's the bit.
Exactly.
Pretend to be a professor just to... [crosstalk 00:22:50]
"Multiple and neighboring for 13, correct?"
"Multiple and neighboring for 13, correct?"
13. Multiple and neighboring. Is that correct?
Is anyone completely sure about number 13? Look. Look here. Hey. Hey.
Multiple and neighboring. Okay.
Multiple and neighboring.
Guys. Guys. Guys.
"We've never heard of merge, so it's not the answer."
No.
"He just looks really comfortable. It was a great day today, so..."
Yeah. And he took full advantage of it.
I didn't.
"That's okay. I was at bars at like 19, 18."
"Guys, we have to [crosstalk 00:24:26]."
Because it's due at nine.
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner. [crosstalk 00:24:51]"
"Wait, what are you guys, how do you guys not have nine and 10 yet?"
Oh. Okay.
"Yeah, we all skipped 10."
"Oh, so y'all did everything already? What's 14?"
And I'm guessing you guys skipped 15.
And 16?
Selection.
"Mostly, the latter."
What's [inaudible 00:26:11]?
"No, yeah it [inaudible 00:26:34]."
It was-
It wants you to go through and write in what the array is going to look at. Look like.
"2, 3, 5, 8. 7, 9, 6, 2, 3, 5, 8, 7, and 6. 2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 6. It doesn't change anything. [crosstalk 00:27:08]"
"Oh that did change it to... 5, 3, 2, 8, 7, and [crosstalk 00:27:15]. Swap those."
"This is a start. Swaps with 205. [crosstalk 00:28:13] And then three over and over. Come down look at the five, go [crosstalk 00:28:18]. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9. [crosstalk 00:28:25] Looking at the first one. Looking at the second one. Looking at the third one. Looking at the fourth one. Swap those. 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9."
This is not working.
"Four. 3, 5, 7, 8, 9. [crosstalk 00:28:50]"
I've only said that a million different times. But it's all right. No one listens to little old Richard over here. [crosstalk 00:29:14]
Yeah. It's okay. They just don't listen to reason. It's a brick wall over here.
"I thought I... It tells you it's wrong, it just doesn't-"
It's wrong. [crosstalk 00:29:36]
I did the last one. 17.
What'd you put? I put searching for one.
And the answers aren't already in? Wow. That sucks.
Number eight?
I think we already changed it.
Yeah. We had already changed it.
"Wait, you said one was what? I mean, four was what? [crosstalk 00:30:45]"
Four is one. Five is negative one.
Six is three.
"Seven, binary."
"Negative one. Nine, the last one."
Ten we skipped.
"Eleven, binary. Twelve, smallest. [crosstalk 00:31:13]"
"First. [crosstalk 00:31:18] Multiple, neighboring. [crosstalk 00:31:24] Bubble sort. [crosstalk 00:31:25]"
Skip 15.
"Sixteen, selection."
"And 17, did you do 17?"
Did you do 17?
"I did 17, you guys are fucking deaf."
God. I don't know.
I didn't do the other... I didn't do 15. [crosstalk 00:32:20] I didn't do 15 or 10.
Let me hear 15 again?
"No, he's right."
Asshole.
"2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9."
"2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9."
"I'm missing the six. So they're all missing the six. I'm missing the six. Hold on, damn it. Asshole."
"Yeah, I got to do it again. [crosstalk 00:34:11]"
"I don't know about, I don't know yet."
Seventeen's got to be redone because I forgot the six.
"Toby, what's three?"
"Man, fuck this. I don't care about 17 no more."
Because it's not going to come back. It's not going to bring back six all the way across.
From [crosstalk 00:35:50]?
Go back up to 10.
"Yeah, we got the same [crosstalk 00:36:33]."
"Yeah, we're missing the six. [crosstalk 00:37:10] Fucking hell."
I did. Because I don't think it's going to finish it. Because it's going through each of them.
"No, don't do that. What? Are you just doing the six at the end? Don't do that."
I know. I'm starting over.
If going through each index and checking if it's higher or lower than the one next to it-
No it's not. That's not what it's doing.
Yeah.
Seventeen was wrong because six was missing.
No.
It goes here.
And then-
Yeah.
I knew I was wrong. [crosstalk 00:39:22]
You telling me it's going to move the five back to the beginning?
That's not sorted. [crosstalk 00:40:24]
Yes it does.
That's not any kind of sorted. [crosstalk 00:40:30]
It does say we are now done sorting. So it kind of have to be sorted.
Yeah. That's even more fucked up than it was before.
"That's stupid shit, though."
"They're working on it up there, guys. We'll see what they end up doing. [crosstalk 00:41:20]"
Because nothing works.
"The way it supposed... Well, it works, just not the way it's supposed to. [crosstalk 00:41:37]"
41
Nine. 
We've got two almost. 
"Well, she corrected herself. "
Assholes. 
Yeah. I've already gotten started. 
I had a new-
It was open. 
You've got to stay on top of things. 
"Shit. You? I said you. Oh, I've got the 28th off. Well, not the whole day but like we talked about. I got after 3:30. I put a time in and they accepted it. "
"That's what I did. I put in Woodward Hall. When I got up to walk out my phone was buzzing. It was because it said it was delivered. What kind of bullshit is that? So I don't know. I win in that situation. It's okay. Look. It says Woodward Hall. Charlotte, North Carolina 28262. Bastards. But I'm going to go ahead and order again the same exact thing I just ordered except this time I'm not paying anything. "
Yes. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). This is right around the corner. 
Yeah. Domino's King Tut. You know where that's at? 
So if you go out the front of campus. 
Make a left. Yeah. 
It's right up the road. 
"North [inaudible 00:06:02]? No, I didn't. "
"But I can't do that. What, am I supposed to call them? They have my number. I don't have theirs. "
"Well, I don't have a driver yet so I can't do that right now. I'm sure the wing place is going to be happy they're making the same exact order a second time. "
And they're getting paid twice so. All right. So I've got the array and the dimensions. That should be full so let's see if I can print it out now. 
But they both have the same number though. They'll both have the same random number. I mean I know it will. I've tried that for something before. They'll both have the same random number. 
"Well, times. "
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
For each iteration is what he's saying. What I'm saying is it's going to put the same random number in row that it puts in column. 
These things are really weird but it's okay. I'll print it and see what happens. 
"I'm just now getting print format down. Can we go slower, guys? This is a lot of shit. "
But I'm not getting enough credit for that. 
I need a little more credit for that. 
They're too expensive. I did that this past summer so I didn't have to pay my loans back. I think we talked about that. 
June of 2012? 
"Yeah. They told me I was going to have to shave mine. I was like, ""No, I'm good."" "
I haven't gotten that far. I just want to print the array and see if it's working right. 
"I see it. I'm about to do it right now. Less than. The array ... plus, plus. "
Horrible. 
Bitch. 
Array. 
"Piece of shit. Oh, there it goes. It works. I did it, guys. Mine works. I'm doing it. I'm a badass. I got it. I'm superior. "
Yeah. We'll be making the matrix next. 
No. We'll make it an endless whatever you want to call it. A forever loop. 
"Infinite loop. Infinite array, infinite loop. It'll just keep printing random numbers. "
Because it looks cool. 
The beginning of a scientific movie. 
The screen saver. That'd be nice. People would think you're a hacker and you've just got stuff running. I done lost the assignment. I don't know where it's at anymore. There it goes. That's a completely different song. I don't know what song that is. 
Really? I was singing Let The Bodies Hit the Floor. Yeah. Yeah. You know it. 
"I used to power lift, so you know. "
I've got to have the rock on. Either rock music or Eminem or Lil Wayne. 
Drop The World is my power song. I've got to have Drop The World blasting. 
"Drop The World is my go-to for heavy weights. I've got a video on YouTube where I was dead lifting something. It was a lot of weight I was dead lifting and the first time I tried it, it didn't move. "
So I had to change the song and I put that song ... I'm pretty sure it was that song. So mine acts up right now but it works. I've got to close the work space and start over. It's really slow. 
Random. Everything's random. 
"Everything's random. The next one was random, too. "
"I don't know if it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I hope it's doing the right stuff because the math [inaudible 00:17:41] random kind of got a little confusing for me. "
Yeah. That's the whole whatchamadoozy. Hullabaloo. Let's not put it in there. Let's move you over here to that and do it that way. That works. 
What? 
Two by two. 
If they don't deliver my wings this time I'm fighting somebody. 
That's what it's saying. Estimated deliver 8:10. 
"That's not going to get here at 8:10. I know that already. So next is calculate the average of the numbers in each column, store them in some variable. Print the average of all columns. "
Then find the maximum ... So the maximum average is going to be whichever one is the highest out of those. 
Yeah. Not quite. The average of the columns. 
No. 
"No, you don't. No. "
He's talking shit and he wants to get knocked out. That's all. 
Yeah. But I've got to get some wings and I was told 30 minutes and then I was told five more minutes and then I was told seven more minutes and then I was told it was here and then I was told it was delivered but I didn't have chicken wings in my hand. 
So if this same chick shows up with my chicken and she doesn't have the first bag I might lose it. 
I don't know. 
They haven't gotten that far yet. 
But if it is. 
"I know. But the estimated delivery is not 7:58 instead of 8:14 so we'll see. We'll see what happens. All right, guys. Anybody got the average numbers of the column and the sum variable and did the whatchmadoozy with the hullabaloos. Oh, we're behind. "
Yeah. It's nested four loops. It's saying in the book page 291. 
"You got it? See, now I'm like double hungry because I was expecting to have food by now. You know how that happens? "
I'm double hungry now. 
Yeah. 
The [crosstalk 00:22:18]. 
"Oh, so you did it already? "
Something I [crosstalk 00:22:37] nesting four once again. It's max minus min plus one plus min. It's plus min. 
"Oh, so this whole class is just a lie. I understand. It's okay. "
"So these should really be eight not nine. Eight plus two because it'll be nine minus two, which is seven and then plus one. That's eight and then plus ... Seven plus one, so eight. Then plus two. Nine minus two plus one plus two. For some reason where that plus two matters. I don't understand it. "
Yeah. And its placement is important for some odd reason. Like I can't just put eight. 
Nine minus two. 
So you can do that nine minus two plus one. You can already-
So it's eight. 
Yeah. So what I've got mine as is math dot random times eight plus two. 
Because for some reason you have to have that plus something. Math dot random's an asshole. 
"No. You have to really pay attention to it. That's one you will want to count and see if it has nine or whatever. One, two, three, four, five. "
Yeah. You fill it with one to nine but its size is two to nine. 
12. What do you have written? It's nine plus two. 
It's nine minus two. It's max minus min. 
How to do what? Compare them? 
"Well, they wanted us to save it in Variable. "
"Just because I don't feel like looking at the book, let me see your loops for getting that average that you got. "
That's a fire a truck. 
"First responder. There's not really a fire. It's okay. See, because in the book it did it where they printed it out. "
It is? 
I want to print it like it is on the assignment sheet. The assignment sheet has it printed next to each other. 
So you record each one. 
Let me ... Let's try it. 
"So you said it did work, the averages were correct? "
"Yeah. Do it again and see if you can get a smaller one. Nope, not any smaller. "
"[crosstalk 00:29:35] nine, nine. "
"Six, eight, six, two, one. 31 divided by one, two, three, four, five, six. "
That is way wrong. 
It's double. 
Why is this in tablet mode? I'm not using it as a fucking tablet. Here we go again. Michael this time. 
I hope so. 
Because if not I'm going to kick both of them in the ass. 
What song is that? 
Never heard it. 
I listen to a lot of different stuff. 
Let The Bodies Hit The Floor is a big one for me. 
"I might know what you're talking about but I don't know names too well. Well, see when I was lifting heavy I was using smelling salts, too. The ionium, the stuff that firefighters and stuff have. Not bath salts. It's the stuff where like if you pass out in a hospital they put it under your nose and you wake up. "
"Oh, it's awesome though. It is some awesome stuff. "
I don't think I've heard that either. 
Yeah. I've never heard that before. 
"Google Academy. Yeah. Google fucking Academy. Multi-dimensional array, column, average. "
I know that one. Yeah. I know that one. 
That's an awesome song. 
"Yeah. I mean I don't know the names of a lot of songs. Once it starts playing, especially if I've got pre-workout in me. Yeah. I'm lifting everything I can get to. I think-"
X is rows. Yeah. 
"Because on a graph X goes horizontal, Y goes vertical. "
Mm-hmm (affirmative). X is this way. 
"I'm going to print. Let's see because I don't know because now you're confusing me and I thought I was okay, right, but I'm confused as shit now. "
Why you fucking with me like that you pice of ... Bitch. There with go. I'm already doing that. You're too slow. 
"Well, that's awesome. "
"Oh, no, I'm trying to get his attention because we were trying to figure out which was what and how the things-"
"Oh, look. He actually called this time, see. Hello. Yeah. You outside? "
I'll be in the front of the building. 
He looked like he was just out. He had somebody else in the car with him. 
If you hit it hard enough. 
So we have to create new arrays. 
So you've got the running totals. You've just got to save those running totals. 
All right. 
The same way we did it before. 
I mean we've only done it already. 
I just need the loop to get the average. Do you mind sending me that loop? What'd you do? You deleted everything? 
"Nine, 14, 21, 30. 30 divided by one, two, three, four. "
"10, 15, 21 divided by five. No, one, two, four. 21 divided by four. "
That works. 
I've got to make my averages. 
You all are just going to destroy my charger. 
There are none back here. Why can't we have wall outlets like normal classrooms. 
Wants to be extra and shit. 
You don't know until you try. 
"No, it's not. It stopped. "
ASAP. 
I know. I just say ASAP. This is not a doctor's office. We don't say stat. 
"Statistics. You don't need statistics. Hey, buddy, you're going to leave your umbrella for me. Is that mine now? "
Yeah. I would. Can't really use an umbrella on a bike. It goes south real fast. Either it'd go real bad or I'd turn into Mary Poppins. 
I'm still trying to figure out these brackets. 
He put it directly into the array. 
"Yes. But it's being saved into the average. You bitch, you know what it's supposed to be. So it's just not going to print it now. I don't know what's going on. "
It's out of bounds but I don't know why. 
34
"It's saying two is out of bounds, which I guess technically it is because there's only two. So it would be one. "
So let's do-
Sara. 
Let's try that and see what happens. No. What the hell is that? 
"For what, the last part? I think it's-"
Which one is the highest. 
Yeah. That's what I got from it. 
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight. So right now it only works when there are more rows than columns and I don't know why. "
"Well, let me see how you saved it then. Let's go to-"
"Yes, ma'am. "
Inmate 41.
"Yes, it's recording."
Yeah. I'm inmate 41.
"Inmate 41, Inmate 42, nice to meet you."
"Yeah, yeah. It's okay. You'll get through it."
Good Friday? I don't care about Friday.
Really?
Seriously?
There's nothing going on?
Neither class?
"Yo, that's lit. I'm down. My apartment?"
I'm right across the street from campus.
"No, I'm in University Crossings. Right by [inaudible 00:01:29]."
"[inaudible 00:01:37]. So, are we going to do everybody gives some money, and one person go buys alcohol, or are we all going to bring our own alcohol?"
"So, you can't buy anything."
"Damn. I feel so old. He's 21, [inaudible 00:02:08]."
This is how I think.
"Do, re, mi, fa, so."
"Oh, whoa. Hey. Children."
"All right, so this is activity what, 22?"
I don't know if I have a favorite word. 
"Yeah, I mean that's up there, yeah. "
"Yeah, very. You can use it in any situation, it can be good, bad ..."
What the fuck?
It's fucking amazing. 
"It's a noun, it's a verb, it's an adjective, it's amazing."
[crosstalk 00:04:13]. Y'all are terrible. 
"Oh man. Wait, no, we really got to figure out what we're doing Friday then. If we're doing this, we got to figure it out now. "
Saturday is the day. 
"After three o'clock, I'm working until three, three thirty."
I told them I couldn't work after three thirty. 
"Must be nice, must be nice. "
[crosstalk 00:05:20] ... 
"No, no no. "
"It cleans you out. It'll clean you all out, yeah. That's basically a game of Russian roulette, that's what that is. "
Let's make it real good. 
"Let me find out if I'm working Friday, we making plans and shit. There's no way I'm working, because they never schedule me on Friday, but I've been invited to a party, so we'll have to celebrate what we're celebrating and then I'll go to the party, how about that. "
"Yeah, I'm working Friday morning. [crosstalk 00:07:09] ... "
"No, I don't work Fridays, because that class is so late. I work Friday mornings. "
If I wasn't working I wouldn't be awake. 
"Yeah, did you see my set this morning? There was nothing to do. I was chilling in there with the music playing. "
[crosstalk 00:07:36] ... 
[crosstalk 00:07:48] ... 
Now she's [crosstalk 00:07:54] ... 
Walk it like I talk it. This is a pretty annoying sing. Do do do do ... 
What is it we used to code with? 
What is it called?
"Or we could be the pre-game. Because it's my pre-game too, I've got a birthday party to go to later. "
Somebody I work with. 
"That's the plan, we've got to get it all figured out now. Because I know I work that morning, but I don't work at all for the rest of the day, and all my classes are canceled, so."
I think he might just be a reserved person. 
"Hey, hey, overachiever. "
"Yeah, we've got spaghetti junction, and then ... Yeah. "
Seriously?
"It's max minus min plus one, so yes. Times one. "
Where is that?
Is your [inaudible 00:11:03]? 
"I get the bag, and flip it and tumble it. "
"Why do you type like an old lady, dude? "
These darn computer machines. 
Why can't I just write a letter and put it in the mailbox?
I could go make a cup of coffee ...
It's not us. 
Why'd you do that?
Yeah. 
"Fair enough, yeah, okay. "
"Yeah, it's pretty pointless. Redundant, actually."
From something else?
Yeet.
Five by nine ... 
"Was that the start of a movie, is that what noise was?"
"What, you've got one of those?"
"I'm sorry, I apologize, that was really mean."
Oh. Okay. 
Just one? And you made it this far? That's amazing. 
"That is a very working cell, that is one hell of a mitochondria. "
That's awesome.
The creatine was too much. 
[crosstalk 00:14:39] ... 
Senor. What the hell did you just do?
It's okay. It's all right. 
Whoa. 
Bag of dicks?
"You know they sell those? Like little confetti dicks that you can send to people? Like a gag dick, when they open the box it explodes?"
"No, but you can send it to somebody, like anonymously. "
How's it going sir? 
"That's a big group, yeah. "
Vertically.
That would be really cool. Kind of like tic-tac-toe. 
Back to back. 
[crosstalk 00:16:42] ... 
What?
He said ... 
[inaudible 00:17:37] every time ...
Aw.
But he has nothing on his feet. You can always count on that. 
"Yes, yes. "
The peachy-o's are better. 
I'm going to take two. I've never had a watermelon. 
I appreciate your generosity. 
"Toby, if you come Friday ... "
"I said, if you come Friday, I'll have the hash-brown casserole. "
"Well, we've got to decide where it's going to be. Is it going to at University Crossings or is it going to be where you're at?"
"[crosstalk 00:18:53] ... Yeah? All right, so I've got my array full of zeros. "
One one. Why are there so many? I thought it was just one one per row.
Okay. 
Whew. 
"Hold on, let me pause the music, I can't hear shit. Go ahead. "
Why is my sister calling me? Hold on. 
Hello?
Hey. Huh?
"I'm sitting in class, what's up?"
"No, what's up?"
Kristin wants to know when I'm coming home? I don't know.
"I'm going to have to ... She'll be home when, this weekend? That's a horrible time."
"I mean, I planned on celebrating Saturday ... "
[crosstalk 00:20:27] ...
"I mean, it's Easter, and we don't have much going on. Like, a lot of my classes are canceled Friday, so we're sitting here in class trying to figure out what we're going to do Friday, but ... Hold on, let me check my schedule really quick. "
[crosstalk 00:20:50] ... 
"Oh, that's expensive."
I forgot how to get to ... [crosstalk 00:21:04] ...
Hold on. 
[crosstalk 00:21:08] ... 
I won't know until Thursday.
"Yeah, I won't know my weekends thing until Thursday, but I know they're really trying not to give people time off on Sunday because it's a holiday and they're probably expecting it to be really busy. But I did take off for Saturday night. "
"Okay, how long is ... Is she staying the whole weekend? So Friday through Sunday. Okay. All right, I will be in touch when the schedule goes live. "
[crosstalk 00:22:00] ...
"No, oh my goodness. And it's already too late. I'll call first thing in the morning. "
"All right, thanks for reminding me. All right. Oh, I mean it's a [inaudible 00:22:18] classroom, we're all just working on stuff right now. "
"[inaudible 00:22:19] all right, bye bye. "
Family calling me. 
I get those goosebumps every time ... 
"You do not have two lines of code, it automatically prints the public class."
"Oh, man. "
[crosstalk 00:23:01] ... 
"[inaudible 00:23:06] so every time, we're just going to update the very first [crosstalk 00:23:13] ... "
"That was a horrible picture, my guy. The glare? Come on, now. "
[crosstalk 00:23:23] ...
Were you expecting us to Photoshop it?
[crosstalk 00:23:34] ... 
I can get a better picture from sitting here. 
"I lied, I can't. I don't have a digital zoom. That sucks. I had a bad phone before. "
I get those goosebumps every time ...
"Okay, that's useless. [crosstalk 00:24:29] ... "
"So, what is the display for? "
[crosstalk 00:24:36] ... 
Okay. 
[crosstalk 00:24:36] ... 
So that's putting in the random zero and one?
[crosstalk 00:24:49] ... 
"[crosstalk 00:24:59] okay, that makes sense. And then it displays it, and then it prints. "
"So after that display, you just need to put instead of a system out-print line, you need to put [crosstalk 00:25:11] line or a basically a prompt, so ... [inaudible 00:25:17] or press enter, that way it'll pause in between. "
[crosstalk 00:25:26] ... 
Just got to figure out how to get it to check where you want or not.
"A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a-mil-a-mil [crosstalk 00:25:39] ..."
[crosstalk 00:26:28] ...
"Hey, weirdo. "
That was a terrible whisper by the way. They can hear you in China. 
Little China?
"Yous' a motherfucking problem. What's a goon to a goblin? Nothing, nothing, you ain't scaring nothing. I don't know the ... A milli. Lil' Wayne. Tha Carter III. It's a really old song, it's okay. I won't blame you. "
"You can do a wild loop, you can do a do wild loop ..."
[crosstalk 00:27:20] ... 
"Generator? Hold on. Can we go back to your code? Where did you declare your array at? Oh, you did it static, okay. "
"Because I didn't see it above it before, so I was wondering why yours wasn't working [crosstalk 00:28:12]."
[crosstalk 00:28:12] ... 
[crosstalk 00:28:23] ... 
I don't know what I'm doing ...
That's a lot. 
No it doesn't. 
"Oh my god, that's just cheating."
"You just got to put in an input, a scanner, because then it will actually pause. "
What? What? Why is half the class gone already?
"Hey, speak for yourself. "
No. 
"No, no, [inaudible 00:30:45] ... "
[crosstalk 00:30:58] ...
"All right, so do I not have to initialize it with the zeros?"
"So I just got to, okay ... And that's just the rows."
That's a lot.
Whew. I hate sneezing. Why the fuck did I just type that again?
I'm fucking hilarious. 
We should just turn it in. 
"You got to compare codes, guys. That's how we get better at this stuff. "
"Oh, what is wrong with the shit on my phone ... "
Why is mine so stupid [crosstalk 00:33:51] ... 
Impossible?
He did. He really did. 
"We already figured our how to do the sum of a column, all you got to do is figure out if the sum of a column equals five. Or whatever it is."
No. Nasty things come out of there.
God damn. 
What's the use of that?
"Yeah, we got to lunch every Wednesday. "
What's fucked up? What is? The code?
The yellow? Oh.
What numbers?
Oh ... 
"That's what I put is as, I don't know."
"Yeah, you can change the color of everything. "
"Hell, I don't know if you can do that."
I don't think you can.
You right click and you hit preferences. 
You go to editor. 
"Yeah, you just right click ..."
"No, it's your right nipple, that's the right click. Yeah. You see it? You see the menu, it just popped up in front of you?"
A fat cat. 
Oh.
"I could do that on something else, I don't think you can do that on Eclipse. I don't think that was Eclipse. Because I could do that on something else. "
I haven't broken it yet. 
Does anybody remember how to do ... The ... The sum of the column?
You son of a column.
Bitch. 
"Hey, hey language. "
Language. 
"Yeah, we did it before. "
I'm surprised you found that so fast ...
"I know, but you do what, control+f? Let me just snatch that up really quick. "
"He slipped something in it's drink, so it just opens right up now. [crosstalk 00:41:26] ... "
