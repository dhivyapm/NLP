"[inaudible 00:00:06] Put it on your shirt, bro. [inaudible 00:00:08] put it on your shirt. "
"Yo, there she goes. [inaudible 00:00:13] like, ""Oh my god."" "
"But, yeah, bro, he grew. My brother grew. "
"Like 6'2"". "
We had different dads. 
"I mean, he plays JV. "
"No, but they gave him fucking [inaudible 00:01:45] merchandise. "
Yeah. 
True. 
[inaudible 00:02:30] 
[inaudible 00:02:33] 
Or UNCC? [inaudible 00:02:35] 
You all went to state? 
What [inaudible 00:02:47] 
Where's that at? 
Where'd [Engram 00:02:55] go? 
Put it on my shirt. 
Can't do it. 
[inaudible 00:03:42] 
"But no, the doctor said my brother's supposed to be like 6'7"". "
I was like... 
Because he's 14. 
He's like 14. 
"He's a stick, though. He be walking like this. "
It's like you need to get in the weight room. 
His arms are skinnier than mine. 
Robert [Brokowski 00:04:35] or something? 
I've known about that dude for a while. 
He doesn't play for the team. 
"Yeah. He just goes to school, works out with them. "
All right. Let's get this done. We have nothing. 
[inaudible 00:05:07] how to write methods. I might write methods. 
"Yeah, it's easy. It's like- "
"So, to do like a method you got to do like... "
"[inaudible 00:06:19] So, [inaudible 00:06:21] "
"Yeah. [inaudible 00:06:51] Yeah. So, you'd be like... "
Yeah. 
It's just whatever you want to put in the method. 
Yeah. 
"And then, you [inaudible 00:07:07] So, it's like being like, ""All right, so, I want to put..."" [inaudible 00:07:22] You get... That's actually what it's supposed [inaudible 00:07:24] "
It's just-
"Yeah. So, this is your main method right here. So, all of the methods that you call go in the main method. "
"Say, like- "
"Say, like I want to make a rectangle method. Right? So, I do like... What's the area of a rectangle? So, you do like N... I'm going to do double. Double length equals 5.5. "
"Just to demonstrate it. And then, double width is 3. And then, you do a system dot out dot print line. See? And then you go... And then you print out length times width. [inaudible 00:08:44] Then, this, when you call rectangle up here. "
And run it. And it's going to print out the answer. 
And then just [crosstalk 00:09:05] 
Yeah. 
"Yeah, look at this. If I delete this..."
It's not going to do anything. 
What is that? 
"Okay. So, in this activity, you will write a program that prompts the user to enter a shape and its dimension. [inaudible 00:10:44] look like [inaudible 00:10:45] "
I have questions. 
Nevermind. 
I'll just do it the way I want. 
I just did program one. 
You said what? 
Like a what? 
"Rectangle, triangle, circle. "
Yo. 
"What do we need for a square? We just need one side, right? "
Times four? 
[crosstalk 00:15:40] 
Okay. But we just need the length of one side? 
Okay. 
[inaudible 00:15:58] 
Where at? 
Okay. 
A capital letter? Where? Why do you have to put in a capital letter? 
"I used switch statement so that if you don't put anyone in, tell them. Tell them on the thing in quotation marks. Make sure it's capital. And then, if it's not capital it's going to come back and you'll be able to put them back up to the main method. That's what I did with my first assignment. I used methods like this. David thought I cheated because I was using methods, but that's the only thing I actually knew how to do. And he was like... But, basically, if it's not right, you can pull them back up to the thing instead of the whole thing just crashing. "
Mm-hmm (affirmative) 
Yep. 
Yep. 
"It just means the first character. And this? Look at that. Now, put it in... So, wait, let me see. "
And that's a character. There. 
I don't think so. You can make it capital so it's always capital. 
"Yeah, it'll matter. It's case sensitive. "
I just told you. 
Nevermind. Ask him. 
[crosstalk 00:19:35] 
"Oh my god. Look at this, bro. Look at this, bro. This is what he's talking about. "
A UML. 
"It's a big flow chart. Whatever. All right, let's finish this. "
I already did the square one. 
"Basically. You're basically just writing mini programs in this, and then organizing it over here. "
I didn't understand anything. Because I think I heard them say [inaudible 00:24:20] 
[inaudible 00:24:20] David. 
I haven't seen that man in like three weeks. 
"For the assignment, does it matter if we use if statements or a switch statement? "
Okay. [inaudible 00:24:43] She said [inaudible 00:24:51] because it's better.
Yeah. 
Just because. 
"No. Am I tripping? Oh, yeah. "
"Uh-uh (negative) Oh, it's U? UA? "
Is it? It's UA. 
Yes. 
Because you probably spelled square somewhere else wrong. 
"Because that's a semicolon, not a colon. "
"Hold on, hold on. [inaudible 00:27:37] "
[inaudible 00:28:05] circle? 
Do you have to make it capital? [inaudible 00:28:33] 
Nevermind. [inaudible 00:28:41] 
[inaudible 00:29:36] chill. 
"Bro, you never created your square method. So, it doesn't know what that is."
Hm? 
"No, no, no. There's the main method that organizes everything we're doing right here, and then, there's separate methods that you call- "
#NAME?
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
Are you talking about square? 
Because I have square created. 
Like if you went down here outside of the method and you did public static void square. 
No. 
Yeah. Because you still want to be in the class. 
How do you find the area of a circle? Is it [inaudible 00:30:59]
That's right. 
How do you spell radius?
Hm? 
[inaudible 00:31:49] square [inaudible 00:31:52] There you go. See? It went away. 
Yes. 
"Bro, you been spelling square wrong for... How old are you? "
15? 12. 
Jesus. 
"After spring break, it gets bad. "
Only a month. 
You're [inaudible 00:33:35] 
How the hell do you do square? 3.14 times the radius times the radius. 
You can't put [crosstalk 00:34:29] 
You don't have to do that. That's hard. Isn't it pi day? 
Stop. 
Where? 
"Oh, we're about to be done. "
Look at that.
"Look at this. So, circle. I want a circle. [inaudible 00:36:16] choice. Oh, you know what I didn't do? I didn't call it back to the main method. It'll correct me. Okay. If I did something wrong, it'll be like, ""All right, that's not something."" And it'll make me put [inaudible 00:36:55]"
"[inaudible 00:36:58] radius, four... Let me make sure that's right. Hey, that's right. Kind of. Now we just need to do rectangle and triangle. Triangle's hard. "
"Oh, yeah. You're right. "
[inaudible 00:37:55]
[inaudible 00:37:59] 
"Oh, your homie out. "
We got two minutes left. 
I want to do this at home and you do the flow chart. 
[foreign language 00:39:11]
Are we? 
"All right, all right. "
"No, we're... "
"No, I was... I'm not done. "
I was moving it. 
[inaudible 00:39:36] freshman. 
"No, this is a rectangle. "
"Yep. Bro, I got to wake up early tomorrow. "
Okay. That should be done. Now I just have to try it. 
We still need the flow chart. 
"All right, [inaudible 00:41:29] All right so, what do you mean for a triangle? "
"What do you mean, though? Like what [inaudible 00:41:42] variables? "
What is this? 
"Yeah, but why is that height [crosstalk 00:41:55] "
Oh. 
Like that? 
Let's see. 
Hold on. 
[inaudible 00:44:08] What's the base? 
[inaudible 00:44:11] five [inaudible 00:44:12] six.
The base is five? 
[inaudible 00:44:15] six... 
15 [inaudible 00:44:19] 
Yeah. 
"Oh, wait. We have another one. "
"[inaudible 00:45:03] method, which checks [inaudible 00:45:05] number is odd or even. "
"We did it before. You just basically do modulus two, and if it's equal to zero, it's even. If it's not, it's odd. "
"But why is it... So, for the second program, it's asking us to get odd or even, but what does it want us to do with the method? "
[inaudible 00:45:37] first part? 
I'll ask Chris. I'll ask Chris. 
"Chris does too, kind of. "
[inaudible 00:46:25] 
"[crosstalk 00:46:30] For the second one, it wants us to see if the numbers are odd or even, but what does it want us to do with the method? "
But like... 
"I know that, but you can do that in just the main method. "
"So, what? You just do it in a separate method and just call it in the main method? "
Do you have to do that? 
Like that? 
The method gets an integer of the parameter [crosstalk 00:47:12] 
[crosstalk 00:47:14] Okay. 
Hold up. I think I know how to do it. Not you. Talking to [inaudible 00:47:28] 
"Bro, did she... Oh, she's right there. I thought she left without her recorder. "
Yeah. 
Give me one second. I'm going to go see what [inaudible 00:48:14] doing. 
I didn't. 
What? 
Where's the [inaudible 00:51:23] Don't give that shit back to me. 
Done. 
Six.
All right.
"Uh, no don't do that."
"They're fine, yeah just put it online."
There you go.
You're welcome.
Yeah okay.
Hope you got that too.
Oh the answer? Yeah.
Aw I wish I had my textbook.
"Wha- what are you talking about, there's a textbook online."
"Oh. Well I mean, I got it for 20 bucks so it's not that great."
Forever. I just don't come to class sometimes so [Truther 00:01:30] doesn't get extra credit.
What are the other ones?
I don't- I don't-
Question one.
I still need to get caught up.
Oh.
"Oh no, that has no points to it."
Number one has no points to it.
Why would I know?
"No bruh, it's literally a sponge. Chill, that's how every mics work."
"I mean, I don't mean to be funny. I'm genuinely one thing."
"How long is this class? Oh, yeah I gotta go."
Oh yeah you have the...
"Oh, I was right."
"Hey Taylor, did you actually enjoy it?"
"On Spotify... I mean, I can. I just gotta get it edited."
Okay. No it's done. It'll be sent to my email by Monday.
"How? Yeah I am, I'm working on it right now."
"How do I upload it to Spotify? Um, you have to send it to-"
"I have one of my songs with somebody on Spotify right now, but..."
"Ah, I wouldn't show you right now."
"It's funny. It's not like, me singing. Here, you don't... it's whatever. It's my friend's thing. It's called Steeze God, and it's like Studio Time is one of the songs."
Steeze.
"Yeah, it's not like that good or anything. I made this last year. He said, ""Hey you wanna feature on my song?"" I was like, ""I guess""."
It's the one at the very top.
It's 400 I think right now. Not that much.
Which ones?
"Like, I'm not even at six. Which one?"
Yeah the three and five. We didn't know about four.
I know! What about it?
Is it good?
Oh.
"All right, shit is hard."
So what is it?
What?
What?
What?
[inaudible 00:13:43]
I accidentally ignored his request.
"No, I hit ignore on accident. I wanted to hit the x... then..."
No.
Who's Josh?
Ah look he's not gonna...
Can you answer some questions. Oh Josh sending.
I don't think that's how you spell it.
My quadrants.
"You guys, I'm right. I got em all right."
"All right bruh, [inaudible 00:17:07]"
Why?
Can you send em?
Bruh he lit that shit up bruh.
"It's fine, it's fine."
Is it the same?
"Come on, like..."
"All right, can I..."
What did you say?
What'd you say?
You did not say thanks.
"Bruh, it's extended. I'm leaving. "
Hey Chris.
Crystal Meth.
David.
David not here today.
What's his excuse?
"I did, we're done. Chris beat you."
"Six, I win. "
"Christopher, stop. "
I can't even put mine on. This clip's too strong. 
"Oh, I'm pressing at the wrong plate."
There we go. We're good. 
"Sorry. What the hell? Right. This is, like... okay. Okay."
When what?
I'm on five.
It's technically anonymous. 
How do these work? How do you read these?
So it's the index of...
"Wait, wait, for what question?"
I'm talking about five.
How do you read that?
How do you read five? How do you know?
But it's not there.
"Negative one? That's easy. One, two, three. Okay. Oh, my God, bro. "
"What are you doing, bro? "
"I am sick, bro, but I need this extra credit. I [inaudible 00:04:24] come in the morning though. Trying to skip school in the morning. "
Eight is one. 
I'm trying to scroll right back up. 
Yeah. 
It should be dead. 
(chime sounds)
Who's playing the animated openings? What the fuck is a bubble sort? 
2001
Fifteen.
Encore. Encore.
"Hey, get on the mic."
Y'all dumb as hell.
"Yo, what's up with 10? "
Oh. Wait. Are you trying to email to me that when you're done?
I love you.
Step one. 
"Double-click it... well not double click but, like, right click. Look at it in the book."
That's the one thing I wish [Mac 00:09:34] had. [crosstalk 00:09:34]. 
Huh?
What?
"No, dude. I don't know what this is. "
"I'd say binary because lineal search, you could do one or you could do however long the array is. But binary search, you're always going to do seven circuits."
Or if you just want to be lazy.
"More efficient, I guess."
Yeah.
"[inaudible 00:11:25]. Yo, David? David? Thank you. David? David."
I don't know what this is.
"Yeah, bro. [inaudible 00:13:05]."
Still checking the whatever.
Did you see [Westbrooke 00:13:10]?
"Twenty, twenty, twenty."
"[inaudible 00:13:34]. Hey, ask her about the thing. "
"Oh, that's for the case study."
What the hell?
So just submit it like that.
Three.
"Zero, one, two."
Four?
Why?
Thirty-three.
"Oh, you're right."
It's the first one.
"Oh, wait, this is kind of easy."
I don't know this one at all.
The last one.
Three?
Is it three or two?
"Oh, I thought two."
"Oh, no, no, no"
"Oh, so just cut off the mid one?"
Okay.
"Look at you, smart guy. "
Yeah.
I'll take that.
"I could've done that. I was going to read it. Who the fuck reads it? They told us the answer. It's like, ""Is it this one?"" ""No."" "
"No, no, no. "
"Yeah, just do that. Okay. I have no idea how to do sorting. "
Group me.
Or text.
He literally said he got his girlfriend to do it.
It might.
What'd you get?
Does this thing happen where your [inaudible 00:21:33]. 
Look them up.
"Oh, create?"
Huh?
Four and five? Uh [inaudible 00:22:20].
"One and negative one? Oh, wait, wait, wait. You're taking Cap-2, right?"
Liar.
"That's what I asked you. Oh, you're a freshman. "
"No. Oh, you're a freshman. You take Cap-2?"
Oh.
It's basically raw game.
It's hard to explain. 
It dropped it? It's binary.
Who's this guy? 
This guy just walked in here. 
He looks familiar.
He looks familiar. 
"Does this look like a David lie to us? David, what do you guys do then? Is this the only assignment for today?"
"David lied to us, man. He said there was more than this."
We're computer science students.
"Yeah, I don't... sorting is..."
"What's 12? Oh, you guys got all of them?"
What's second?
"Oh, okay. Pull up 13. Pull up 13. Do you guys use sorting in 12/13."
So what do you do?
Why are we learning it?
"Okay, yeah."
"Okay. What is a merge sort? What is that? [inaudible 00:27:33], do you have that problem where this doesn't update?"
"So this, it's charging, but it's at 82 and it's not updating. So I turn up... as soon as I turn it back on, it'll be at 86."
It's not showing me the...
Nevermind.
I do have a map.
"I mean, you can probably do that but..."
What?
It's not trash. 
You're trash. Don't ever ask me for nothing ever again. You smell like fish. [crosstalk 00:28:37]. 
"Dude, I'm on 14."
The largest. 
Because it's smallest and so...
No.
Yes. What is this? 
[crosstalk 00:30:15] on your scarf or your... [crosstalk 00:30:18].
I'm at 14.
So it's multiple.
"Oh, okay."
What is that?
I'm going to put down three zero.
Yes.
Yeah.
"Five. Oh, shit."
"Oh, five and eight."
Are we just putting them in order?
"The bubble, bro."
"Oh, the two or the five."
Then it starts at eight now?
Oh.
No.
Yes.
"So that's two, three, five, eight."
So it starts at three?
No.
Okay.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  [inaudible 00:33:40]. Man, what the fuck? I learned this, like, four years ago."
"I took AP computer science in high school, my junior year."
"But my teacher sucked. I'm pretty sure almost... like, 90 percent of this class has taken some sort of coding class before."
I'm part of that 10 percent.
[crosstalk 00:34:18].
I just lookup YouTube videos.
YouTube videos.
I learn by example.
"What are you doing? Please don't break that, please."
[crosstalk 00:34:47].
I thought you were picking up the brick.
"But these things are, like, $100."
"David's stepping all over your wire though. Hey, bro. Hey, David, get off my wire, please. These things are, fucking, $1,000, the wires themselves. Okay, I'm going to show you now because it's charging a little bit. But look at this. Okay, I think I did update now. Sometimes it just doesn't move until you... like, you have to turn it off and turn it back on. Do you have 16? Do you have 16? Do you have 16?"
"Oh, I got it. Oh-oh, I'm lost. I need Sarah."
"Here. Of course I got it, bro."
What? I'm speaking Arabic. 
"Yeah, Arabic Arabian."
You said you were from Saudi Arabia.
"Bro, when you first [crosstalk 00:36:49]"
"Yeah, bro. [crosstalk 00:36:49]"
You're not. 
"Yeah, you're going to jail. Whoo, whoo. "
Do you know [Sissy 00:37:18]? Do you know Sissy? [inaudible 00:37:20].
Yeah [inaudible 00:37:47] this computer. He a G. He real as shit. [crosstalk 00:37:53]
"I think she's explaining... so [Megan 00:38:05], how are we doing over there? He's doing bad. How are we doing?"
How are we doing over there?
"Well, that's one hell of an answer, or not. Why are you wearing jeans, bro?"
Work? Where do you work?
Why don't you want me to know?
Where do you work?
I work at Just Pizza.
You lying.
I work at Just.
Yeah.
I should ask.
"You don't eat fish, dude. I thought you were a vegetarian."
"Oh, goldfish, oh. Oh, we fucked it up."
"Saretta? Hey, yo, y'all got 17? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Was he explaining 17 on this shit?"
"What the fuck? Wait, wait, wait, wait. "
April 9th.
Six. 
Six. 
Give me it bro. Give me it. 
"Put it on, put on. He's going to be mad. "
Yeah. Huh?
Get the cap stick. 
Oh. 
That one's two numbers.  
The length? What do you mean? Like figure it out? 
In this? Right? 
What do you mean? 
"Okay, yeah. "
Right here right? 
Would you like just to- 
Put numbers in there? 
Okay. 
It wants- 
The random numbers? 
"Yeah, that's- "
"No, random integers. We did that right? "
"You take your array. So like [crosstalk 00:19:05]. I'm in array. All right. Do you have to put that? Then, [crosstalk 00:19:13]- "
"Okay, so you have to do- "
Yeah. 
No. 
Number with the declared value goes on the left side. [crosstalk 00:20:57]. Yep. You got to populate you [crosstalk 00:21:20]. That's the size one. 
I don't know dude. [crosstalk 00:21:40]. 
"No, no. She said we're doing two, four groups because [crosstalk 00:22:02]. Morgan SOS. SOS. [crosstalk 00:22:15]. We're lost on an island. [crosstalk 00:22:22]. I'm stuck. How do I fill my main array. "
Okay. So I have this for a loop? 
For the what? 
Okay. How would I do that. 
From two to 10 right?
Add two to nine. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
"Okay. So, [crosstalk 00:24:10] okay. I'm lost. I'm still lost. [crosstalk 00:24:22]. "
And I'm going to make- 
J [crosstalk 00:24:57]- 
Oh my God I love this guy. I'm going up with that. [crosstalk 00:25:2].
He declared some time before you. [crosstalk 00:31:07]. 
"[crosstalk 00:41:32] is it because, actually I'm not supposed to say [crosstalk 00:41:40]. "
Yes. 
Can I see your co part? [crosstalk 00:43:41]. See the first part. 
So what does this do? 
"Oh, okay so this it putting the rows and columns, this is- "
Making numbers in the rows in columns. Like in the boxes. 
Oh. [crosstalk 00:44:10]. And then how would you print it? 
Light squaring? [crosstalk 00:45:50]. Okay. 
Oh. 
Okay. Got it. [crosstalk 00:46:51]. 
Okay. 
"There's new colors, what colors? [crosstalk 00:50:28]. "
There's not new colors. There's not new colors. He lied. 
There's not new colors. They're still white. 
It said rumor. I saw a link that said rumor. They just haven't [crosstalk 00:51:46]. 
Six.
You see assignment four?
"Yeah, [crosstalk 00:00:33]."
It's like [inaudible 00:00:36].
Do you ever close out tabs?
"Oh, my God."
"You have to create a jungle, and insert animals in certain places. You have to ... I'm going to get Sarah to do the [crosstalk 00:02:11]."
I've done something like this before.
This video doesn't link to anything. There's no ...
Nothing.
"Yo, you understand?"
Can you show me?
He has consumption.
It's consumption.
[crosstalk 00:05:38].
It's tuberculosis. That's what they called it in the 1800s.
"If you had tuberculosis, you died."
Right. I want a [crosstalk 00:06:05].
"This is how you print it out, but I don't know [crosstalk 00:06:17] put it outside the loop?"
Conspiracy theory. It's stuck. [crosstalk 00:06:54].
"No, but it's [crosstalk 00:06:58]. He said that [crosstalk 00:06:58] we can help each other out."
[crosstalk 00:07:03]?
Where are you at?
You have a circle going on.
"Hey, come closer."
Huh?
[crosstalk 00:07:24].
I'm going to-
Bunch of bologna. I knew it.
I'm not going to give you something that doesn't work. It doesn't work.
"[crosstalk 00:08:12]. That's another [crosstalk 00:08:14], right? Are you still trying to get a ..."
"Oh, okay."
"Shrink the matrix. Make it, like, two by two. Then, see if you win. Or, three by three."
Wouldn't be that hard.
It would take two seconds. Just got to change the random number.
I am so lost. Do you have answers?
Do you have answers?
"Oh, you're copying me right now. My bad."
Did you not copy and paste it in the thing?
[crosstalk 00:10:05].
[crosstalk 00:10:05]?
I don't think so.
"Hey, Siri?"
[crosstalk 00:11:41].
It activated mine. 
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not. I've done ""Hey, Siri"", like twice. Do it."
Why am I fag?
"Hey, Siri?"
"Did you hear about the new MacBooks coming out? They're, like, the 16.5 inch MacBooks."
It's only a rumor.
"I don't have a [crosstalk 00:13:14], so I have to-"
Yes. Why?
"Yo, why is your shit British?"
"Yo, Siri?"
What money? Line 10. [crosstalk 00:13:47]. What'd he do?
"Those people are done, too. "
"No, those people are done."
I met the long-haired dude the other day.
I don't know. Martin was doing it while she was explaining. He's still not done.
Close the other thing.
It still said try again?
Are you guys making progress?
"Why is [crosstalk 00:15:11] holding his thing to his mouth, in his hand?"
"He was like, fucking Angie."
Five by nine.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
We fucked up. 
You have opening brackets right there.
You need a semicolon.
Fucking water.
There's a Papa John's on campus? You fixed it?
We're NCI.
"Where is he? Oh, he's over there."
Extra credit.
[crosstalk 00:16:33].
Why are you saying that?
"No, shut up."
"No, shut up."
"Reef, what's this say? [crosstalk 00:17:48], what's this say?"
"No, dead ass, what does it say?"
Are you serious?
I don't know. It looked Arabic.
I'll parlay with y'all.
I'll play guardians [crosstalk 00:18:26].
"Oh, it's [crosstalk 00:18:43]."
It's at the same time?
[crosstalk 00:18:58].
No more play zigs.
"No. 2,600."
It's a Band-Aid.
"Dude, you know you can download your information from Google? You can do it-"
You watched the video?
That's crazy.
Google.
"Google downloads your information. If you have a Google phone, and you say, ""Hello, Google,"" it's recording even before you said, ""Hello, Google."""
It's recording you at all times.
"Say you have all your photos on your Google phone. They're saved in a public URL, even if they're to uploaded to Google Drive."
"He was looking at his things. He downloaded his information from Google, and it was 120 gigabytes of information from him."
"He was like, ""What?"" [crosstalk 00:20:47] one of them. He was like-"
"It showed all his pictures to that date. He was like, ""That can't be true."" He deleted one of his pictures on his phone, and-"
"He went back to it, and it wasn't deleted. It was still there. He went and it saved in a URL, all his pictures. He was like, ""That can't be public."" He went on another computer, not signed in, and he copied and pasted the URL into it, and it popped up."
That wasn't even uploaded to a Google anything. It was just saved on his phone.
"Now, watch this."
"Siri, are you recording me?"
"It says, ""I respect your privacy, and only listen when you're talking to me."""
"I think honestly, Apple's one of the better privacy-"
You fixed it?
Not like that at all?
Like creating the Matrix.
I need Spiderman to help us.
"Yeah, remember? The [crosstalk 00:23:08]."
"No, no, no. We're talking about another class."
"No. [crosstalk 00:23:28] where she's like, ""If there's a holiday, that whole week, we don't have class."""
"[crosstalk 00:24:10]. Okay, okay, we'll do that. Plus, we'll have this thing [crosstalk 00:24:12]"
"Within, or [crosstalk 00:24:18]?"
We're not going to play a normal [crosstalk 00:24:19].
No.
"I know, but [crosstalk 00:24:19]."
[crosstalk 00:24:19] that song goes.
(singing)
"Come on, bro. All right. Hit Sarah when she's done."
Right there.
You know something? Sarah had a fiance [crosstalk 00:25:15].
Yeah. There was [crosstalk 00:25:22].
"He played Fortnite? Funny, he played Fortnite, dude."
Why you only play Fortnite? Free to play?
I play everything.
I do.
I play fighting games. I play shooters.
"[crosstalk 00:26:26] so fucking behind on my math classes. I haven't taken any math classes, and I need math for 1215."
"You need, like, pre-calc and stuff."
"I have to take the what's it called test, the test-"
"The placement test, I have to take it tomorrow."
It's here.
You signed up.
"No. Whatever I test into, I got to take over the summer."
No. I need [crosstalk 00:27:23].
"You have to bring your ID, your CP ID. I'm going to have to Photoshop a-"
We need help.
We need help.
Can you help us?
All right. 
I'm lost on the creating the slot for the one.
"Yeah. I made the matrix and stuff, but kind of ..."
I'm stuck on this part.
"Yeah, calm down. Please calm down."
I don't think it's [crosstalk 00:28:49].
[crosstalk 00:28:49] nothing.
Is that my phone?
It was a timer. I never set a timer.
Bet.
Nine?
"Yes, it does."
I can literally just ...
You're good.
I is going this way or this way?
One through nine? Perfect. I got it.
[crosstalk 00:33:21].
"Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative)."
Yeah.
"For checking each one, you would just do ... "
Which one are we checking?
"Yeah, go ahead. I'll try to ..."
Huh?
What?
No.
Kind of.
You figured [crosstalk 00:40:19]?
[inaudible 00:40:26]? Are you ...
Do you want a mouse?
Yes.
"I want to leave, though."
Did you just get grades?
I resubmitted a [crosstalk 00:41:35].
