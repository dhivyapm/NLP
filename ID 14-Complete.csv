"Just checking if it works. Yeah, it opens, it opens, just keep uh, putting pressure on it. "
"[crosstalk 00:00:28]. Oh, you locked it. I don't know, it would open. Yeah, it doesn't open. Yeah, you're just going to have to hold it. Drop the mic. Drop the mic. Cause every time you finish a line of code you just drop it. I'm just kidding, stop, take this seriously."
Are you guys interested in-
"Try to figure out, probably it's locked or something."
"That's what I noticed, so, put this here for a sec."
Okay. Look. Mine opens.
What if you scream at it? You scare it and it's open. That's what a microphone does. It's broken. It just doesn't clip open. This one. Just deal with it. Hold it.
14. You look like a bad-ass TV host. Doesn't give a fuck his mic is just dangling.
"Ah, it's gonna fall!"
Where you going?
Yeah. Wonder. Nice.
"Wires. It hurts itself in its confusion. Hold on. Okay. I'll put this on my pocket, okay?"
As in- [crosstalk 00:03:43]
"Are you telling him to enter a string? That's an output, so that's a parallelogram."
Are you asking him to enter a string?
"Okay, so it's a parallelogram. And then when you get a string, it's almost a process. So, I think our input. So input would be...let's research them again. But I'm pretty sure the first one if you're asking him something, you're outputting a message, your system goes out, it's always...."
Index? 
Index. What?
"I don't think so. It's more of...if it exists, just put a counter."
"If it's not this one, it's probably this one."
Let's work on two together. I finished number one.
"[crosstalk 00:12:34] [inaudible 00:13:04] I think so. No, no, listen. Just do the flow chart and do the [inaudible 00:13:25] code and...but the code's right there. I'll show you how."
"That's bullshit, though. I'm just kidding, not really. It doesn't make sense."
What if you use the same name for something and just keeps giving a compiler error?
It's just four.
"Now think about it. But if you want to put five, put five."
"Four. What? It's bullshit. Dude, I'm so failing all of these. I feel-"
"16% oh my God, man."
"No, before. Because it, from zero to four, because it should be less than five."
Local variable line...and 1.22.
"No, dude, it's a signature. It's a signature, trust me. I'm just kidding, you actually was gonna"
I'm just kidding. But it sounds like it. It sounds like it.
There's only one. [inaudible 00:18:26]
"Yeah, it's probably six."
Watch it be another option down there we just didn't see.
I'm parched. I'm thirsty. I'm gonna get some water.
"Wow, what is going on?"
"Even when we're just joking, and we say it's probably going to be eight, it was fucking five."
"No. Yes. No, no, no. No."
"Actually, you're right."
"There's a small select few, 5% I think got over three."
Same.
[crosstalk 00:21:25]. What?
"Yeah. How much did you get from the...shit. We were like, but you know what a method was? I thought a method was just like the thing that goes...yeah. Yeah, it's probably eight. And I was like-"
"Okay, do you want to copy this?"
Send it?
"Oh, from my phone? Okay."
"I swear, I swear. It's almost like if you...you know in certain prisons they...they-"
What's up with my phone now?
So it's g.
"right? So instead of entering a letter, make a set of variables that if it was o or u or a or i You just need to add one more thing to it, okay? Instead of having an if statement that counts nothing, you know how over here I had to input a word, right? That gets taken out. Or not taken out. Occurrences. Enter [inaudible 00:23:05] counted occurrences, or the last vowel, u-"
"Yeah, you would count that. So, just the flow track for it. It's very easy."
Huh?
"[crosstalk 00:24:37] From today you're 14. [inaudible 00:24:41] Sounds like, I don't know if you know enough [inaudible 00:24:45] for this. Do you know that the [inaudible 00:24:52] just give me a sec."
Are these the parameters?
But what do you put? You put string and something? Or...
Are these parameters?
Are these the parameters?
It's what gets put in over here. In the...
Can I put the variable of an input? Can I put these two down here?
"Okay, okay. Yeah, I got you."
David?
"Question. Since this is [crosstalk 00:29:34], how do I set the parameter to this?"
"You know how like it takes a string first, and then integer?"
You just type in string?
That works? Just type ...
Why doesn't it work?
Is there ...
"That's right, return zero, let's say. What was it? [inaudible 00:30:26]."
"Or, return two."
Can I use more than one method?
"Unnecessary, because problem two wants us to use-"
"What happened? How? He's cheating. You need to write the [crosstalk 00:32:08] method, and something that takes in two, right?"
I got the input for the first one.
All?
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Zero. Is it supposed to return more than-
"Yeah. First, it was an int."
"That's impossible, unless it is not ..."
How will that take in a parameter of a string and a integer.
[crosstalk 00:33:13].
I tried making the capital ...
For this?
"Then, this is-"
Doesn't the main method include everything? This is an extra one right?
"oh ok ok This is the class one, right?"
I have another question?
"Right now, if I entered, let's say, ""hello world"", and then 5, it will take ""hello world"", then ""5"" right?"
Because of the integers? I was thinking of void. I was thinking of putting in void.
so I put just text in the index?
and What about this?
"Yeah, it is. It is."
The return value that [crosstalk 00:35:04] for ... What if you're returning than just a integer?
"What if I'm returning a string that got edited? Right now, I have to split this. I have to split this, right? If you can …"
If I can return more than just an integer.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. True, true, true. I need to return it split into two. I need to return it twice."
"Then, instead of a zero, I'd return-"
No?
Yeah.
That's what I was thinking.
so A void does not need a return?
"That is exactly what I wanted. Now, what's the void value exactly?"
It doesn't return anything?
Can it [crosstalk 00:36:48] something?
"so I can call it back? , so it does return something?"
"Int, or index."
"In there, I figure out the loop."
"ok, and Then, instead of taking it back to the main one, I can do system [inaudible 00:37:47] print the-"
"Okay, gotcha. Thank you so much."
You doing two? Are you doing two?
"Nyah! Be like, ""Fuck this."""
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say the ""f"" word. We're being recorded. Double trouble, "
"You, have you figured out number 10?"
"Can you show me? Did you physically go through the index, and then click a space, and then move to the next line?"
Quick question: can we use sub strings?
No?
Yeah.
"Thanks. I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:48:11]. Then, what do we use?"
Kind of. Can you just explain that again?
I run it-
I run it until it's less than two?
"Less than index. Then, plus plus, right?"
On ...
Print character until?
"Oh, okay, okay."
"Char at I. I do this, and then I put system to auto print?"
"Text, like this?"
"Then, the other one's going to be inside this, too?"
"Okay, got you. Oh, okay, okay. I just copy this."
"All right, thanks. [inaudible 00:52:17] getting hard. Nah, it's fine. [inaudible 00:52:20] j ..."
String?
To find the vowels?
"You can make, ""if 'a', or if 'u', or if 'o', or if 'e', or if 'i', then count this one."" I don't know, that's something you could use. Did you copy the thing I told you?"
"Yeah, put a [crosstalk 00:53:08] outside. That's the thing we took today, and we messed up. For the first one? Yeah. Did you finish the second one? I'm stuck too, so when I figure it out, I'll tell you. Did Ethan just leave? Did he finish? Did he finish? Ethan. I can get it from him, in a way. Are you Taylor? Alright Okay. Entry equals two 00:54:14]. Yeah, yeah, yeah.[inaudible "
"I'm, like, loaded. It's like, we're [crosstalk 00:55:18]."
"To let the character ... Where the index is, right?"
The second one.
"You still put it less than, right?"
That's what I wanted to see. Thank you.
"Wait, i can't see that. If text dot index [inaudible 00:56:07]. Yes, but why is there an error?"
You what?
"It's not a Boolean, though. I have no idea. Give me a second."
"Hey, Morgan? What happened when you printed it up, though? What did you print out?"
"Listen. Since this is attached to me, I'll come over. I have both, low key."
I might blow up your brain farting. Just give me a sec.
Which one? [crosstalk 00:58:02].
"Bye, guys."
"We don't need to get input, right? "
Did you just say...
[inaudible 01:03:46] Yeah. This sound like we curs each other out. [inaudible 01:03:47]
This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna pull out one of the strings.
That's not gonna work.
"For the [inaudible 01:07:34] run, do you just multiple by nine? Because really, the minimum is just zero, right?"
"Yeah, it's max minus minimum, minus minimum plus one or something. I don't know, right?"
"It would be one minus one, ten minus one [inaudible 01:08:08]"
"Ethan, Ethan? She's in the group, try to get her in the circle."
[inaudible 01:08:30] to her?
Yes.
Yeah.
Exactly. [inaudible 01:08:41] But so did you guys multiple by nine?
What are you doing?
 I’m not sure.
It beats Crocs honestly.
"[inaudible 01:11:35] did you, oh fuck. [crosstalk 01:11:45] Do you remember when he was wearing the [inaudible 01:11:58] jeans?"
I really like that [inaudible 01:12:05].
"Honestly, true true."
That should have been yes. Extra credit for that.
Morgan?
"Yeah, one second, one second. So-"
"Okay, so I'll show you what I did. How do you declare..? Im not sure what I did ..One "
"Look. So, since he puts his own size, right? How do you make it go through every single neutralization of this? Gosh, it makes so much sense now."
"Okay, but how do I make the size increase? He can be printing zero, zero, zero every "
[crosstalk 01:14:24]
"So listen, I made it by less than size, right? But how do I choose the index to make - so I'm made the third loop, right? That loops every single time, to be less than the size. "
"single time. Okay, so let's say I want him to print out zero, then one, then two, then three. Not zero, for [inaudible 01:15:18] amounts."
I counted...
"I plus, plus, right. Yeah, yeah."
"[inaudible 01:15:34] Yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:15:36] goes to I?"
"Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That works."
"But listen, this time we go, we code."
Then us.
"No, no-"
Yeah.
[crosstalk 01:15:59]
Yeah.
"When me a Morgan were talking, but we're gonna have some prepared questions."
"And we'll have, not a time limit, but we'll do them by the time, and after we're done we're just chilling."
Literally.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're gonna pick from the last three chapters. I pushed them from the last two chapters."
"Four through seven? Yeah, that's actually perfect."
Exactly.
[crosstalk 01:16:42]
"So, it gives me this error. Can't convert into brackets."
Huh?
What day? 5:15 on Wednesday?
"I have class, like 50 minutes after that."
"Yeah. True, true, true. So if it's convenient for most of you guys then go for it."
"Yeah, those are the best times. So after one of our classes, most of us are free. There's one class and then the other class is just, some people have it, some people don't."
So it's giving me this error of-
"No, it's saying something cannot convert into array. I just want the-"
I'm just trying to make a loop that goes through all the sizes. So like he puts in 10.
"Okay, and then so the size is like [inaudible 01:18:32] number, but I don't want it to print out only one size. I want it to go through all the sizes. Go through all the numbers, like 10, 11, 12, 13, 14."
"So, you see how you need to make a random number for each one?"
"So I want to be able to set to 10 to a random number, 11 to a random number."
Exactly.
"Oh, okay."
So the index-
"Not a random number. I want it to increase with the loop. That's why I made a loop, so this should be 10 because the [inaudible 01:19:41] number below 10, right? Right, and then-"
But you still want it to look-
hmm..Okay.
yeah..Right.
I got you. Right.
"So since this is - okay, but I want it to ... I want it to know [inaudible 01:20:09] from source - oh, so source is the name, right?"
"don't really need to use any more, right? The loop is already powered up by that size?And then size is just the number, and we just use this number to create the loop? We "
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And in a way we kind of don't even need size anymore."
Right.
"Right. One more question. Since there's [inaudible 01:21:10] right? Do I just multiple by nine since it's like the minimum is zero? So like max minus minimum, plus minimum plus one or something?"
zero nine?
Yeah.
Times 10?
Okay. [inaudible 01:21:34]
"Great, thank you."
That works.
What?
[inaudible 01:24:14] I kind of exit out of the library [inaudible 01:24:16]. I can't open anything.
[inaudible 01:24:25]
Thank you.
"Wait, what have you finished, [inaudible 01:25:29]?"
The what?
"I'm working on the random. So you finished ""B""? Keep up that work."
"Okay, I'm almost done with ""A"". I'm actually done with ""A"". What happened to everyone?"
"[inaudible 01:26:01], can you repeat that?"
"Yeah, that's what he told me. And I was kind of thinking of that, but instead of multiplying by 9, multiply by 10."
"I don't know, if I tell you what I'm doing, you're gonna hate me. I'm too lazy to write [inaudible 01:26:22] random, so I'm looking through all my other…"
"Dude, no, but trust me. It's gonna pay off when I just have to copy paste. Oh, that's the future."
I actually can't find it.
Does it run?
found it.
Part A
I finished part A. [crosstalk 01:27:48]
I guess I didn't finish part A.
I guess I forgot to print out -
"It looks, it looks pretty good."
You miss iDubbbz?
"That's not the only reason he's like ... okay, maybe that's the only reason people know about him, but I know him from filthy frank."
"But, do I just search in source? Hey, how do you display an array? How do you display an array? You just go like -"
"Alright, I'm in a four loop, right, but like-"
"Yeah, okay, thank you, thank you. I'll be with you in a second, Ramon. Can I run this? On this cross? [crosstalk 01:29:31]. It gosh darn worked."
That's not it.
Why? Oh it's supposed to be called source.
"Okay, you didn't use println right? Honestly, it looks much more neater. But if you have preferences of that, I'm not gonna tell you anything. The little max equals to-"
"Yeah, I'm gonna do it like that."
"What do you mean not reference the what ? So you print A, right?"
What's this for then?
You didn't finish it?
Why didn't it work? Why didn't it run? Yeah.
And how did the index of max is equals to zero? It's always zero so you're always asking the max to be bigger than zero. Right? The index of max is nine. Wait what? I'm confused so hold on let me see. And I was counting-
"No we can ... hold on, give me a second."
It's actually the best shit out there [crosstalk 01:32:07].
Starbucks is better than Dunkin' Donuts.
"Listen, listen ... one time I took this before class and I just keep seeing him taking it, right? I actually like did stuff in class. I take Starbucks like every now and then, nothing happens. [crosstalk 01:32:46]."
Wait you actually?
"Fix that thing, did it run?"
"What channel, what channel?"
"Yes, he puts in 10 right? So what's the point in web scale ... like you do that only for strength. But here they already gave you 10. You already told them how many numbers are in this, right? So it's just to make it much more ... but can I say something?"
Now this one doesn't?
"Like this is my way ... [inaudible 01:33:37] way. No, no, no where are you going."
What's up with your Math.random.
Its the same thing as mine. It's always ... okay.
"Okay, I equals to this is zero ... okay ... I tried to put like the mine and it still doesn't run? Okay, times 10."
I'm just looking like actually ... you did the exact same thing. Yours gotta work now.
"No, no, no, no ... there's something wrong."
What?
This one?
"Will that work? Okay, one second. You didn't set ... you didn't set ... okay, next. What? "
One second. What the f?
You can have it sideways ... I'm sorry for like [inaudible 01:35:05] I'm just [inaudible 
"01:35:06] this myself. I look like, okay, that's number one, number two, number three-"
[crosstalk 01:35:10] that way. But-
"Your code is identical to mine I don't know why you have this problem. You wanna change isn't ... like this and ... oh, I was doing this and trying to do his way, but it's like almost the same way. I tried to change it the same way, he has an error there. Is it 'cause of this?"
Gotcha.
Cast it to-
Gotcha.
"Hey, thank you."
"No, no, that's the reason why. Oh, let's go in 10."
"Oh my God, did you not put a fuckin' ... I can't believe you."
Oh my God. This is ... what part are you guys in? [crosstalk 01:36:45]. Where did like Ethan and -
Really? They just finished?
What part are you guys on?
"Part what? Oh, I'm part B. [crosstalk 01:37:13]. You skipped Z? [crosstalk 01:37:20]. Oh, alright so you tell me what I do here?"
Yeah.
I changed to nine. Are you sure that I'm right?
"Put it back to zero, okay? Then turn the systems on, show me what happens. Okay, how can you use I twice? Change [inaudible 01:37:48], this is probably gonna cause problems."
"No, no, no. I don't know how you didn't get a promo already. Like when I make a list, I have int-I, int-J."
This is gonna cause you problems. Like do stuff like you ... like has been known to cause some stuff.
Where show me?
What the [inaudible 01:38:30] products ... no this is cancel.
How do you like go up? Is it like-
"You did that, not me."
"Fuckin', mother fuckin'."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just get like-"
"this is like touch though, right?"
"No it doesn't work. Oh perfect, so I can point with this. Now I know a use for it. But so, where did you copy this from?"
Where are you ... what part are you in?
"This is roam around, please. Like, roam around, check some-"
"No, no, I'm just like ... I can help you with the first one ... second one. That's where we've reached, you know?"
"No, I didn't change anything. You shut the-"
Oh okay. Oh that's why. That's why.
Alright [crosstalk 01:39:50].
Oh my God.
Shut the fuck up. Alright. Okay we've been cursing a lot buddy. Do you know they're like gonna sue us for this?
"Students ... have you not read the student book? [crosstalk 01:40:07]. No, you're not "
allowed to curse more than three times. And you should excuse yourself after each 
time. They're gonna have to censor this. They're gonna have bleeps and stuff.
"No, you're bullying me. [crosstalk 01:40:31]."
"No, you told me you studied the arrays. I'm like okay this is actually nice, curious.Just "
carry it on. I'm really sleepy today. When am I not sleepy?
What did you guys do for part B? Yeah. Another four loop.[crosstalk 01:41:05].
Same as part A?
Sames as part A?
"No, no, no. I mean source I ... I mean source J equals to eight. [crosstalk 01:41:30]."
[inaudible 01:41:37] this goes to nine?
Like the max value goes to nine.
Okay.
"Oh, so you're comparing. Okay but we already know that nine is the biggest value. So-"
Oh I wanna do all like four.
"Exactly. Oh, okay. Makes sense. I'm just doing lap top."
What is in preview?
"Okay, so. Why is not mean to ... oh, if I see, one [crosstalk 01:42:42]."
"So how do you print out the index then? Alright we'll get it right. Yeah, you need to "
know which ones actually-
"Oh, so I print out I next to the J [crosstalk 01:43:30]-"
"Yeah, okay."
No I's the [inaudible 01:43:38] and J's the value of what's the max value. Can you see 
"that? Like, okay. I is like the index, right? Of like the whole thing. It's actually size. Okay, "
"then J is the one, like we compare with the max value to see if it's the highest value, "
right? But we need to know at what point was it the highest value. That's where I shows 
"up. At I, J was this. And it was the max value."
M. [crosstalk 01:44:29]. What happens if you have more than one max value? 'Cause she 
said we wanted more than one index? So at some point we're gonna need more than 
"one nine showed up. You know what I mean? [crosstalk 01:44:47]. Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"Look, look. Find the maximum value of any of them showing the value of the next set "
"value. So if you had like two nine, you're gonna print one and ignore the other one. "
[crosstalk 01:45:05]. True. I was thinking of looping something that kind of goes through 
"everyone and then if it is, it just prints it out."
"Oh, yeah, exactly, but that's just like, hey let's ... we can ask, if this is what needs to be "
done. Seems very excessive. Did you figure it out?
Why?
"You're printing out the index of max. Is it always increasing? Go down, go down, go "
down. Scroll down through the console.
"Yes dude you figured it out. So it was two, then three, then five. Like okay. Go up. Wait "
no these ... are these random numbers?
Are these the random numbers from I?
"There's a seven, there's a nine."
I can't do this tomorrow. I have to go to another movie.
"Dude, I hate movies. Huh? When is this due? No, no, no ... huh?"
"No, no, no, tonight. It's tonight like."
Exactly.
"Yeah, now he's a movie fanatic. He's going to see Wolves, scary ... he knows almost "
"every director, every editor, like you know. He knows every movie that's coming out. "
"Every move that came out at states. But it's fun. He always offers to pay for mine, so I'm "
"like okay, I'll go but I wouldn't pay for this anyways. [crosstalk 01:47:22]."
"No, I think class is over."
Huh?
Okay.
"You know what we should do [crosstalk 01:47:55], we should do this together."
We don't like go through parts. You know what I mean? We go through like every part 
together.
"Yeah, you dipped. We're like waiting for you."
Literally outside.
Yeah and you just went then like-
You're like fuck this shit ... can't curse next to it.
Oh.
"No, but like, how did you do? [crosstalk 01:48:35]. No like, I'm 28 I think."
Really? Okay. What about under 20? [crosstalk 01:48:52] Okay.
"Shit. Okay, let's see. [crosstalk 01:49:02]."
"Yeah, right now. Skylers working on his game"
They have us for like 48 minutes.
And it might actually open. Is yours open?---
April 2nd 
So last one compiles.
I think there's like ... I would suggest something better but this is like what I think.[crosstalk 01:55:40].
Really?
"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's like the only out of ... when you come in our cancellation-"
"Like, you do to conflict, like, cancellation."
Multiple cho ... what the?
"Kay, listen. Got it. Got it."
Yep.
"Why, what's up? What's part three, then?"
Yeah.
"Okay, let's leave this for a second. Fill in the blank. When a method returns an Array ..."
"Okay, we have to open the book for this one. ..."
"Better be safe than, like, guessing. Especially with this one that we can know. Oh, "
"[inaudible 01:57:12]. Drew, repeat the question. What's the section about? It's 7-point "
"what? 2? 7.7, okay. ..."
(Silence)
7-point ...
(Silence)
In your Array? [inaudible 01:58:03]
Can you read me the question again for me?
"You're right with the index part, but let's just be sure, that's all. ..."
"I think I read it, but I'm not sure if that's the one. ... Look, heres 7.7. One second, here ..."
"7.7, right? You can pass Array's when working [inaudible 01:58:49] method, may also "
return an Array.
I'm not gonna say which one. Show me.
"Yeah, the three and five, we didn't know about four; I think it's [crosstalk 01:59:08]"
"Okay, okay, we'll do that. We'll type in index, but let's read the Array result. So, we know "
the function returns a new Array. Why not value though? It just returns index? It 
"depends on the curve time. Like, if you're asking it to return ..."
Are you sure it's only from 7-point ...
"When a method returns in Array, the index of the Array ... Okay."
"No, I'm just like, if it's possible to make ... [crosstalk 01:59:49]"
"Yeah, cause it just doesn't make sense. As in, like, why would you return an index of the "
"value? You put this in the method, and you do something to the values of the method. "
"Why would you just return the index? Unless you, or specifically asking it “Hey, when "
"does nine show up in the Array?” You know what I mean? I see, it makes sense if you "
"want to put index, but its only if you specifically ask the return, but I could be wrong, I "
didn't study. ...
"So we just, look. Line two, creates a new Array, right?"
"Line four to seven, “copy elements from Array list to Array list a result”."
"Yeah. If you return one ... like, what's he gonna know from ... If you return two? He's not "
gonna know anything from it.
"Return, result. Nah. These are going down. ..."
"Okay, let's go through this, alright? Public static [inaudible 02:01:22], okay. He made an "
"Array, and it's the stop length."
Okay for [inaudible 02:01:34] length minus one. What's up with minus one? You guys 
did it over there.
So you want it start from minus one?
"Right, but why did you put plus one instead of minus one? You're saying, if it starts from "
zero [crosstalk 02:02:04]
"Oh! Okay. Say it me. So, just the output. We're just changing the output. If we put plus "
one it plus one it will be index eight. Keep it there.
"It's just going to keep falling off. Okay. And for, [inaudible 02:02:18] zero, J equals the "
"result ... Okay. I equals, I understand the stop length. I plus plus ... It's just weird. Okay, "
it's completing. ... Why's there two conditions? Oh no ...
We set this to that ...
(Silence)
"So I increases and this keeps decreasing. And then, unique result J, which is the thing we "
set here. Our result of J equals this list of ... Where's list? We didn't create list. ...
"Oh there we go. Result is list, not length. And list is something we got. ... Isn't the mean "
"method, this like a method, just a method as it is."
"Yeah, so this is Array. This is the value of index. This is just the index of ... Oh! "
"Remember how we returned a number to, a method and this made it the right size? "
" onBecause, it's size. So imagine List is seven, okay? We put in seven here. Seven keeps "
decreasing. I keeps increasing and set result ...
"Yes, exactly! That's [inaudible 02:04:08]. Here, let's go here and keep going until they hit "
the middle. Are we returning index or are we returning like value?
Reversal? So ...
Exactly. You're gonna say ... When the method returns an Array ...
Sure. I mean ... let's ask around. Why should we ... Wait value doesn't work. ...
"Hold up. We don't know, because we checked the book and it still didn't tell us. One "
"second ... Wait, what'd you guys put for question three?"
"Like, the first part? ... Was it index or value?"
"Like, when the method returns an Array, the blank reference ... So is that index in a way?"
Where is in the book? We looked for it.
"I've ... control F. It doesn't work, I know. I've tried this before. Like it's ... [crosstalk "
[crosstalk 02:05:53]
So what does reference mean? Like it returns the values?
Would the index?
Those are the indexes.
So why would we return the ... okay. This is not a question we can ask now.
Then part five. What is it? ...
"Okay, after the line is combined ... Okay, we're really going to go with this."
After the lines come five.
You want to show your answers?
Yeah.
What was it? What did you put in?
"We can ... What? ... [crosstalk 02:07:10] empty, different, Array, returning ..."
"Okay, thank you. Thank you guys. ..."
"But how is it ... okay, I'm just going to ask him about this later. ... Array is set to a different …"
"He's a yes. It was a yes ... It was a yes. Wait, what? ... Don't click yes! Don't click yes."
"So this is the correct answer, here."
No. [crosstalk 02:07:55] No. It's this. ...
Part five wrong. And part three is ...
"Kind of, yeah true."
No. It's reference.
"Okay. We need to put [inaudible 02:08:35] of like, here."
(Silence)
Which one?
Why? How did you ... Did you get the answers?
"For, page 258."
(Silence)
"Yeah. ... I have the book open. Just tell me ... function for [inaudible 02:09:14], the value for "
(Silence)
"Okay, read the question to me and I will tell you what do put in, because I'll read it with you"
Is a ... reference. ...
Comma? Tell me when there's a blank.
Same. It's the same. ... So it's referencing same right?
Okay. Use the codes above for the next few questions. God dammit. It's another one of 
"the part A and part ... no, no it's not."
It's 10 right?
"On A? On A, B."
"It's basically, here. Like a ..."
"That's true, it's not returning anything. ..."
Do I put this ... Copy this ...
Watch ...
(Silence)
"Which one? No, first one. Yeah, we're doing it. ... I mean ... This is why we're supposed "
to help each other. That's what ...
"So, look. I ran the [inaudible 02:12:13]"
"I ran it. So go through A, B in order."
"Before the call is five. ... B, one, before call? ..."
Makes sense.
"Okay, so here's the thing [crosstalk 02:12:45]"
Okay and then ... [inaudible 02:12:59] ... What's over? Is this new question?
What about the [inaudible 02:13:20] [crosstalk 02:13:20]
Yeah.
Nom of zero's gonna be two. ... What if it's a trick question?
Go up. ...
"What's the point? Okay. My bad. The nom of three is three? It's three, I mean."
Inside the method ...
Do they want after? ... [crosstalk 02:14:04]
I don't know.
"No. After method A, you're right, it's 10."
"The weird thing is, why did this turn to five to two? ..."
Okay.
Yeah I know but I'm talking about the after method call. After method call is two.
Yeah. ...
[crosstalk 02:15:11]
Okay. Are you ...
"Right. We put A, A doesn't change. We put B and B changes."
"Let's just put two, or if they ask for it."
Show me the ones on top.
"Yeah. Five, six, right?"
"Okay, and then ..."
[inaudible 02:16:39] ... Want to ask?
"Right there. ... Come on, like I'm running out of [inaudible 02:16:59]."
"Quickly, quickly, quick ... [crosstalk 02:17:37]"
There's not point. We're being [inaudible 02:17:40].
This one is [crosstalk 02:17:48] ... [inaudible 02:17:48] ... space [crosstalk 02:17:52]. No 
"like, okay 11 and then ..."
"This one, past reference. Yeah, that one. Click click ... Copies ... and then, the values. It's "
for a second ... makes up... [French 02:18:19] ...
[crosstalk 02:18:26] I know. I saw it coming ... [crosstalk 02:18:30] Thanks.
[inaudible 02:18:40] What are you doing?
"Why, what's up? [crosstalk 02:18:48] One second, one second. Yeah, real quick "
[inaudible 02:18:57] ... Okay ...
"Okay, nine ... Copies?"
The values? Okay.
I wish we studied for this. [inaudible 02:19:15]
"How did we get something wrong. [crosstalk 02:19:26] It wasn't two! ... Then, you know?"
Once again I apologize for what we've done. ...
"Which, what thing?"
Like studying? [inaudible 02:20:03] Yes and we'll prepare some questions. We can 
"Time flies. I've lost track of time, a week ago."
One second ... Okay.
Where's the exit point? [crosstalk 02:21:39]
Where's the exit point? [crosstalk 02:21:56]

14. I have a poem because you were absent.
Pull up the music [crosstalk 00:00:18]
Yeah.
"So, there's nothing in this world, I wouldn't trade it for you David. Your help is top rated. You got me baby. You're welcome. "
"No, we're good."
"No, honestly. There was like no sleep yesterday. "
He's not coming back. He thinks he [inaudible 00:01:01] and then four is-
Four? Four is one? 
Yeah.
"Yeah, we're done. "
I'm getting there. We're at ten now. 
"Nine, nine, no, we're in nine. Why did you get the..."
"What? Why would you ask that? It's because it's a index two. Six is a index one, so a index of...right?"
Yeah. Six is at-
The question nine.
Yeah.
"Let's say our main method looks like this. All right choose the correct puzzles for each step. Why? What is is? Our mid-variable equals, what is going on? What's ten like?"
"Ten be like...no, no, no. There just asking for like where's six? Why would our mid value and whatever..."
Where's the...okay. Our key of six is smaller than-
It's fine. 
Right to it's face? 
"He didn't mean to, 14, 13 is apologizing. "
When we get close and talk to each other they go like boomerang over. Okay. 
I need some more Chris.
"Listen, ten can-"
We can give ten a break. We used a binary for question 11. We can skip this for a second. 
"No, no, no listen. Assuming an array is already sorted, which search method is more efficient for finding and element than an array? For finding it's linear, or binary. Binary? Okay. "
This one? 
searches you can't use binary [crosstalk 00:04:24]
"Right, but assuming it's already sorted, so if it's not sorted, then we would go binary? "
Right. 
Huh?
"Why? My dick. Oh, the mic. I forgot. "
"14, He meant to say his dinner. "
His di...There we go. Yeah. I need to clean my bag. All right.
This was from back when I studied...
"Okay, so..."
"So, repeatedly select the largest number and then swaps it with the first-"
"Yeah the first number, and then it keeps going but I don't know why they don't say that. "
What the-
Smallest! My bad I just read the question again. It's smallest to the first. 
"Eight eight four, the page? "
"Page eight, eight, four? Damn, what a jump. So I'll go with 800 because this is a bit messed up. 850, nine."
"No, I don't use Adobe because they keep popping up this message that's like, ""Yo, buy it! Buy it now! Buy it now!"" You know that, right? "
"Adobe has this like, it's not an official, they don't say official, but it's expired and I need to renew it. So they won't let me use Adobe, or they do but then they keep popping up a message. "
Then you guys paid for it. 
"It should, but I don't know, they keep, oh my god what if it's like a virus? You never paid for it? "
"No, but I googled it and they did say something about like, if you, you need to pay, or something. Oh it's google. What's it called, eight, eight, five?"
"Eight, eight, oh there we go. So what's the question? "
"Wait, what about 12? "
My bad. 
A bubble or a blank? 
"I'm not going to trust it being eight eight four, I'm going to go back a bit. "
Oh look. 23 point seven. 
"Yeah. 23 point. 23 point six. My god. It's so far behind. Okay, 23, I think I'm here. All right here. Bubble sort. It makes sense. "
The bubble sorts...
"There, it's not it though. It's not it, trust me. "
"It is, but that's not, the bubble sort algorithm...no."
"Oh, did you hear her over there? [crosstalk 00:08:46] "
"Largest, what were the two options?"
"Yeah, I'm at two point six now. I don't think it's word for word, we have to actually like look through this. "
"But there's not a single like, multiple or a single or singular. Hey, what'd you guys get for the singular or multiple for the bubble? The bubble sort thing. I think it's 13. Where'd you find it in the book? Multiple? No, that's, no it's not. Okay thank you. Here? I'm literally at it, by the, oh my god! We were reading the black text, and there's like, should have been the, it's right there."
"Yeah, because you don't read the table most of the time. Okay. Figure out 23 point three and make sure you understand the...Do we have to watch this video?"
"We're answering this question. We're answering this question [inaudible 00:11:40] It's the bubble sort. It's just the bubble sort, no matter. Look at question 14. Is the bubble sort another what?[crosstalk 00:11:59] Why can't I? This says nothing.[crosstalk 00:12:46]"
Well [crosstalk 00:12:51]
"Huh? Okay, one second. Very, very fair deal. No, no, no we skipped that, too. "
"Hands over the...no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. I'm good. "
Oh.
But they should have swapped two. 
"One and, now it's one and zero. It worked. So it's one and [crosstalk 00:13:43] Nick knows. GroupMe? Oh, yeah. "
"Chill, mom. "
"Thank you. Sweetheart. Merci. Okay, actually, really fair deal. We have to like-"
"Dave, David? "
Feels so sketch. 
"So, these two we don't know. Ten, four and five. "
"Ten, and then four and five. They didn't show. [crosstalk 00:15:18] On the, where are they? "
"What's four and five? No, they don't show. "
You just walk into class asking the T.A.s questions. You actually go like to the [inaudible 00:16:16] 
Four and five. Five. 
"So, how do you solve them, though? "
"It's linear search? Okay Okay. This is David's report. Look, look...[inaudible 00:17:37] that's the goal. That's the ultimate."
"I'm buying handcuffs, just like running up to you. Now you're mine. I'm a troll, look. They only way you get around is going though me. It's the ultimate fetish. "
"I mean, sandwich. Not, yeah. What's it called, what's 15?"
Oh that's touch. All right what's 16? 
"Okay, so this, so instead of these being variables this would be one and[crosstalk 00:18:45]"
What's...no...
First.
My leg is cramping up for no reason. Ouch. Yo. 
"I knew you were going to ask, that's why I was prepared. Multiple [inaudible 00:19:41]. "
"What's 16? It's sort of intriguing instead of not knowing the question, what's 16? [crosstalk 00:20:25] We should, we should. What's 16? Not you, like this microphone. I'm just kidding, no what's 16? "
"Did we take it, though? Or is it in the book?"
This thing. [crosstalk 00:20:53] Yesterday?
"Dude, I showed up in class in the beginning. She didn't talk about it. "
"Okay. So there's 15 and 17 left. What happened? Yeah, I was just kidding. "
"Yes, that's what I was giving him, too. Trash. This is trash. "
"It's trash. David, can agree. It's trash."
"Let's chat, trash, right? Yeah. "
"Yeah, what's 17? "
Us? 
I wouldn't give it to you. 
So this one...
We deserve a hundred on this because of this typo. We deserve the full credit. 
"It's okay, you will get them later. What's...you mean like it's closer, more convenient. Where are you? Okay, I'll give you a second page 15. "
It's red bull. Five likes and I'll do it. Two screen shots and I'll do it. 
Want to get headphones and then we can hear it? 
"Yeah, just hearing that-"
"At the same, literally. David, question. What's 15? Just give me the answer. No, I'm just kidding. I don't get it. "
Okay. 
And then-
It stops at two though. 
"There's like three. It stops at two. I mean there's four. See, it's like one, two-"
"What, this?"
So I just go by-
"Does this become, wait, does this become two-"
"Well, why? It replaces with this? "
Does it print out the same thing? 
So it swaps. 
"Oh, and then you do this over here again, just like three, two. Well, no. What the frick. Five. What? [crosstalk 00:26:35]"
"Yup, yup. "
"It's going to be A, that's why I noticed, look at this in three, two...[crosstalk 00:26:51]"
"We're supposed to put the smallest numbers here. Oh, okay, and then a two, you kind of keep...why is it not two in the beginning? Wouldn't it make mores sense? "
"All right so that's two. That's three. And then, five. And then, two, three, five, eight. "
"Fucking. I mean, frick it dude. We should get a fact check before. "
Does this look right? 
Honestly I'll step on two. 
Thanks. 
"No no no, it's three. I'll tell you and tab, okay? I'll give you the number and you tab, okay? "
"Do you have a 17? Okay, so three then two, five. Five and then tab. Five tab. Click five tab eight tab. "
"He told me it was correct, so I don't know. [crosstalk 00:29:32]"
"No, show me if you have it though. "
"Can I just take this? So yeah it's three two...I'm right, I'm right. "
"It's not Saudi Arabia, it's Lebanon I just [inaudible 00:29:58] No, when did I say that? [crosstalk 00:30:02] No [crosstalk 00:30:06] I have it on my key chain, I walk everywhere, I say I'm Lebanese, I'm from Lebanon. Lesbian. I mean let's-"
"I meant, I can't write anything [inaudible 00:30:22]"
"Now we only have like 17 left, right? "
"Yeah. What rhymes with...No I'm Lesbian. I'm Lebanese. I'm trying to cover up the other word. So, what do we do here? [crosstalk 00:30:50] Huh? This one? Do you have 17? From? I've checked..."
"I mean...wait this can't be touched. I'm just kidding. I would never. Promise, I will stop touching this if you never jump in elevators. "
"Wait, they're explaining, they're explaining. [crosstalk 00:32:07]"
Don't move it. 
It's also not going to do anything. 
"Oh, it's like the thing they did in class. Six replaces, so it's nine, seven...[crosstalk 00:33:01] "
"Two, three...the second one doesn't change. Third one just switches the seven with the six. Actually no...It's just two, three, five, six..."
"And then two, three-"
"Five, six, seven, eight, nine, and then just replace it again. Two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Wait, what are you doing? I'm going to sneak..."
I'm getting in closer. Wait. 
"Okay, three is two, three, five, six, seven, nine, eight. And then two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine and the same thing. Four and five repeat, right? "
Oops. Yikes. I'm just kidding. [crosstalk 00:34:57] What did I do? 
"Oh, Melanie. You guys...wait, can I see? "
"Then can I know the wrong answer? It's having us...okay, after this, I close mine [crosstalk 00:35:20]"
"Yes, it's a deal, right? "
"Listen, and after this, I end mine-[crosstalk 00:35:27]"
"Low key, yes, he's very accurate with that. But listen, I close mine, and you re-do yours and I'll try another output. "
"Right, makes sense? [crosstalk 00:35:41] Why won't you give me it? [crosstalk 00:35:43] So how much did you get? "
Why is it not one? [crosstalk 00:35:55]
"What's your eight? What's your eight? Question eight, question eight. [crosstalk 00:36:07] "
Huh? [crosstalk 00:36:12] Why? [crosstalk 00:36:14] Why though?
"Okay, so if you're re-doing it, it's minus one. [crosstalk 00:36:24] It's minus one, why is it minus one, who'd you get it from? "
Huh?
"Yeah, are you done? [crosstalk 00:36:38] Wait, what? [crosstalk 00:36:45] "
14
"Okay, we didn't laugh at that. Morgan, did you figure something out?"
Are you hiding something from us.
All right.
"We've got that thing on. Right, okay. They'll get annoyed if we open this, but then how do we have this just hanging like this?"
"I know, [inaudible 00:00:47]."
The TA has his own TA?
Six.
You're an asshole. Look at this dude.
Are you in this one?
Someone must have a nerf war in here.
"Yeah, I'm chill. Did that come from my bag?"
"Give me my bag. Yo, they're going to make me pay for this mic."
"Yo. Fuck, [inaudible 00:03:37] just don't do it."
"Morgan, Morgan. Five dollars and I'll do it. Just kidding, man."
"Brother, I have the book. Show me activity, I can't open two PDFs at the same time."
Making an array.
"[inaudible 00:04:33] two A, we don't have to get two random numbers right? But where do we use the two random numbers?"
Huh?
From 2 to 9?
Oh. So from 2 to 9 and then 1 to 9.
"Yo, pants are falling down. My card key."
Open queue.
Huh?
Fill the array with random integer numbers between 1 to 9. So I just put this in that.
"A random number between, like [inaudible 00:06:05]."
"Inside the thing? 2 to 9 inside the thing? No, I just heard you say that."
Okay.
"Okay, okay."
"My question wasn't answered. Is it inside the... okay, screw it. I don't..."
"Yeah, I know. Let's finish the first two parts first. Yo, yo, my pants are falling. Was it max minus min, minus min, plus one?"
"Was it max minus min, minus min, plus one."
Mia? Minus one? Minus two minus one.
9 and 2.
"Close it up, all of it?"
Okay. Does that work? Should I close it?
Okay.
"Oh, okay, okay."
Okay. Why can't we convert into array to int?
Oh. Does it work? I did. Should I do it from outside? Show me how you do it.
Got you. So we don't put it inside of it?
I know. Oh.
"Dude, did it work? Can you show me again. Does this work?"
"No, it rounds it down, yeah."

Plus 1?
"He has it over there, I can't open two."
A range between 9 and 2. Should I call it?
It's 8.
Okay.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
By 2?
So plus 2?
"But 9 and 2, 9 inclusive, right?"
That's 7.
"Now 8. Like 9 and 2, basically, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. I'm lost, okay."
"Yeah, I think so."
I can copy it from one of my old code.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
That's when we used to do 10. We used to put random number...
Yeah.
Yep.
You get 7.
Which is 8.
"So it's 8, then minus 2 is 7. I mean 6."
"Yeah. One question. Isn't this inside 8? It's 8, and then this is minus 2. So you tart from 2 and then you add 8. So you don't end up with 9, do you?"
"Yeah, it became 8 in total."
8
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"But when you add 2, now it's 10 and 2."
"Yeah, 2 and 10. Oh, and then we don't include 10. Okay, got you, got you, got you. Thank you so much."
"I need to raise my pants. This is too much. I'm nearly trapped by this cord. All right, hold this for a sec. Finally."
Did you figure out anything? My code's not working. Both of them.
"Yeah, I'm stuck at math.random. What have I come to? No look, I have errors, okay. Never mind, never mind. These are my own. You all are on to arrays right now."
What did you do?
"David, look at this and understand where it's gone wrong. I haven't started anything yet. Like, look."
Where?
Okay. Whoops.
"Equals to, do I say int?"
That's what I was going to do. Do I say int or not?
"Here, this is the random number between 9 and 2, right?"
"Right? What do I do with it? That's all you guys asked for. Really, on the question."
Oh.
Okay. [crosstalk 00:22:34]
You have it?
"Wait. Yo, what have you been doing? Is that all?"
Which method?
He's like one of those Digimon.
Digimon? He called it scuffed Pokemon. It's a god damn disgrace. [inaudible 00:23:50].
"Yeah, but still, there's this spot in your heart for the evolutions of..."
Where did you get this from?
What... this goes through both the columns?
"Where's your random number. Oh. You called one row, you called one... Oh, okay, okay. That's nice. Okay."
What's the first one called?
It goes to 0?
Row less than...
"There you go. Wow, I'm really [crosstalk 00:25:45] with the row. What was the..."
"Okay, and then row plus, plus."
"Oh, okay, with the [inaudible 00:25:45]."
Credit to Brandon. Did you do intro?
"Okay, it's giving me an error. Should I have set it outside?"
"Main array.length. Now it went, what the frick."
I have no idea what's going on. [inaudible 00:27:13]
"Well, I got them both wrong though."
What did you initialize yours as?
"I tried to do that and David told me it's wrong. There, hold on. Equals to... Boom, it actually worked. What is going on?"
"Poo poo, pee pee. Okay, and then what did you do with the... Cool. So both of them are random numbers between 2 and 9. The row and the column."
"Oh, they're both the same, like in the same rows and same columns."
No...
As in size of the thing?
True. How is it swimming if this is an empty array? You realize-
I do. Hold on a minute.
My hands are starting to hurt.
Did you try running it.
"True. I need a drill hit. I need to stay awake. Yo, you need to come out with me. Or you can hold this for a sec."
"For the row and column, let's say?"
"Right, but-"
"Can it be like 2,3?"
"Okay, so do them separately. Let's see if that works."
Kill me. Uh oh. Uh oh.
"All of a sudden if you separate it, it gives you a mistake, an error. Don't try to do that."
"The row and column. Yo, I'm passing out, in the light rail, 100 percent."
If she separates it... It's not going to work though.
That's what you did. What page of the book are you looking at.
"Dude, I'm gonna pass out. All right, peace guys."
"I'm fainting any second. If I go back to the light rail, I'm fucked. Listen, listen, if this is due some other time..."
Huh?
"[inaudible 00:36:04] It's in 10 minutes, or more."
My brain.
Do you understand? Do you understand?
[inaudible 00:41:57]
Do you know that... it looks like it's running.
"No, it gave an error, look. See?"
"Right now, we put A, or like the whole thing?"
Yeah.
I think we should make a method.
[inaudible 00:45:51] Huh?
"I'll take a picture. Listen, for part C, you have to calculate the average, right? Yeah, align it. Or take a picture. Because I'm not going to take it from here."
And then how would you print it?
Light's glaring. Column [inaudible 00:47:19] Column in the array... okay.
Oh.
I'll explain later.
Any updates?
"Yo, what's up."
"Dude, I can't. No, no. This time it was homework. No, no, really, homework. Like, I had like two games of League that night, that's it. That's nothing. Two."
"No, that day it was actually two."
"I know, but that's only two games. Usually I play eight, even more."
"Yeah. 25-ish minutes, plus a few."
"It depends, if I'm playing [inaudible 00:53:48] I'm going to go for like ten, easy. Yeah. That's what I usually play. Like earth is literally ten minutes."
I'm not the only person...
So many people.
All right boy.
Really?
"All right, some people have left, let's leave it. I'm going to click on this, all right?"
Dude.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Should I click it?
Fourteen.
Fourteen.
Actually... what does he have?
Oh. Consumption.
The plague.
"Yeah. Did they kill you by feeding you certain seeds, like in the 1800s?"
"This is how you print it up but I don't know what do I put outside the loop? No, no."
"Conspiracy theory. Step one. Brandon, get closer."
"[crosstalk 00:01:49]. No but seriously, get closer. Did we send the Illuminati over here with the circle so we can help each other out? Morgan spill the tea."
Where were you at?
"We have the circle going on. Like, get closer. Like let's open..."
It's...
Let's leave.
No?
"I'll show you. Look. Wait, I'm going to see if it prints out though. Bunch of bologna, I knew it. Doesn't work. One second. I'm not going to give you something that doesn't work. See, it doesn't work."
"It actually does, one second. I fucking knew it. Look, look, look, look, look. Look. See?"
"God dammit. Don't prove me... how? Wait, you knew. Seriously?"
"So that's another four loop, right?"
Okay.
What page was that?
Merci.
"Okay. So, yeah. Okay. That kind of makes sense. You two."
[crosstalk 00:03:58] Speaking of...
[crosstalk 00:04:15]
"You have to use an enter to go through each line, right?"
What if you put the... make another loop?
Click to loop. That's a new way.
