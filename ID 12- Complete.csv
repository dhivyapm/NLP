12
"All right, on the average. What did they average?"
 All right... I think I understand. Location. If [inaudible 00:00:53] is greater than [inaudible 00:00:57].

 Yep.
"Four, six."
Yeah. Whoops. [inaudible 00:02:09].
Wait are you sorting or...
"Yeah, yeah, I see that."
"Wait why are you... no, index equals..."
Mm-hmm (affirmative)
But that's not the index.
It's just like panel whatever. You can't use the index. You need another variable.
"So, I use count off of the count and then I use the index."
It's the thing you're iterating. So...
"Index plus plus, you'll just be uh... count equals index. Or whatever you're viewing for the..."
"Yeah. Uh, wait..."
"Wait, shuffle all elements of the short array and then target..."
I don't know what those last ones are supposed to do.
Hm?
You need at least-
"Well you need at least that many elements to guarantee that... well, technically you need that many elements to guarantee that you have enough space in your array."
"Since you don't whether it's beforehand, they imply you better use your vector here, if there are vectors in Java, but since array, you can't change-"
"Yeah, so it's probably not vectors. And uh... both sides... over two. And then it targets something..."
Okay I think I'm done.
Uh-huh (affirmative)
Yeah.
Yeah...
Why?
Yeah.
"Yeah, you need a separate variable for..."
High number. The J.
"I'm assuming that it wants it in like, consecutive. Not like at a certain index."
Uh...
Yeah.
You just...
Yeah.
"Um, zero four. Average is three. Okay, so that's... so there's size four, so size three. Last two. That's odd. That should a low. "
"It's not doing what I want it to do. Oh, that's why. That's why."
Yeah.
That is not right. Oh size the... I don't know what I'm getting wrong here though.
[crosstalk 00:14:02]
"Oh, I didn't... that's what I did. Did it. All right yeah, I just didn't reset the value."
Yeah.
It's annoying though.
"No no, I did. N target equals... I just write... use the same variable you had tied to it. Size."
No.
Use what you used for the-
Yeah so just put the size.
All right.
Oh I don't think I submitted.
Yeah.
"Uh, I used count."
"Whatever you're iterating, it's gonna end up being count is less than array size divided by two."
Is there an exit form?
Change arrays. Now.
No.
It didn't even say to print the last one. Yeah.
I don't- yeah.
Or you get docked.
"Wait, start is... no start is [inaudible 00:18:12] I got that right."
"Oh you're probably index out of balance, so start is wrong. So it should be wrong. So it should not be..."
Yeah.
I mean that's how mine looked.
Yeah.
All right.
Let me try to get to the bus.
You good?
I think I've lost any of these.
No idea.
12th. All right.
"Okay. I think I ... yeah, this size [inaudible 00:00:27]. And we just need another folder."
I is less than B. [minus plus 00:00:56].
All right. [inaudible 00:02:30].
"All right, I think I did it."
I don't know how to do this.
"I'm trying to print out the array, but it's not working."
"Okay, screw it. I am doing this. [inaudible 00:03:54]"
"Yeah, it's printing a reference. I forget how to get the actual object."
"Okay, yeah. I'm done."
I just outputted the array.
You have to switch to dimension one and dimension ... right now.
Yeah.
"[inaudible 00:06:57] array out of bounds. So, run it again."
I don't know.
"I'm going to check yours out once I finish mine, but I'm basically almost done."
"You can try switching dimension one and dimension two, then. That's the only thing I can think ... in your folder."
That's fucking weird.
All right. Maximum average parameter.
All right.
Just do a minus one.
Do a minus one.
That's that wouldn't work. I don't ... want to ask David?
It only gives you the [inaudible 00:12:01] screw that up.
"Because you get the two dimensions from that, right? And then that sets those as the ..."
Zero.
We gave it minus one.
How's that? [crosstalk 00:13:05]
Mine is like that.
that's pretty much what mine looks like. It's a weird one.
What?
I'm basically done.
Yeah.

Yeah.
"Oh, [inaudible 00:14:22]"
"Yeah, I got you. Okay, cool. All right."
"Basically, it's how you pace that [inaudible 00:14:52]."
"No, you [inaudible 00:14:58] fill it out."
"Yeah. Basically, all you do is ... let's see. So, I made a new array, and averaged both [inaudible 00:15:15] the second value."
And I basically just switched the second value for the first value.
"So, instead, dimension two's on the outside, and dimension one on the inside. That should do it."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"And you have to do that, [inaudible 00:16:11] loop too."
"Yeah, close that check into the [inaudible 00:16:25]."
Hmm?
"So, you go at manual entry."
"Manual entry. And then bracket, dimension two. Dimension one."
Yeah.
Hmm?
"So, go back to your first folder."
"And ... wait, what are you trying to print?"
Print the array?
"First, you got to print the array. All right."
Really?
"They made it confusing. It's really not. Yeah, it's not [inaudible 00:17:50] try to implement this."
Right. [inaudible 00:18:16]
"Yeah, the [inaudible 00:18:29] you just copy-paste the first loop. Wait, what are you trying to ... I mean, that works."
Just do it outside the print.
"No, you have to swap them."
Yeah.
These are [inaudible 00:19:22].
"Oh, you don't use dimension one and dimension two."
You use J [crosstalk 00:19:28]
The average?
"Oh, I screwed up."
You got to switch them. You got to switch. [inaudible 00:20:05]
Yeah. That's why it ... yeah.
"I think dimension one. Yeah, dimension two."
"Okay, so I, J, I, add I. I ..."
"I plus one? No, J plus one?"
"Yeah. J ... no, just J. Because it goes from zero to ... hang on."
wait. Size of the column would be [inaudible 00:21:29]
Yeah.
This one is on the inside. That's like the vertical ... that's how I'm interpreting it.
That was basically all formatting.
Yeah. But we've done that before.
All right.
"So, basically all this is is [inaudible 00:22:55] basically the same loop over and over again."
Hmm?
Wait. You have to have an outside folder.
Check for [inaudible 00:23:24] value.
"Yeah, pretty much done."
12
All right. I was trying to do something with... [inaudible 00:00:30] (silence)
"[inaudible 00:01:18] here, here, here. "
Yeah. 
That one and then that. I think we were supposed to do the average. Yeah. (silence) Yeah. [inaudible 00:02:28] Over here and over here. I'm wearing a wire right now. I'm wearing a wire. (silence)
[crosstalk 00:03:09]
Easy. Line up that. 
Yeah. 
"All right, I'm done with the second part. "
"Well, no. "
No. Let me ask him that-
"Two, three. Two, three, four, five, six. 3.5. six, seven, 21. 21 divided by six is-"
"Wait, what?"
"Yeah, right. The [As 00:05:18] were objects and in this is passed by reference. "
All right. [crosstalk 00:05:51]
"Wait, you don't have to. "
That's fine. As long as I... I try to get it out around the time the bus comes-
"Because I'm not walking all the way across campus. Times 26. Plus... okay, where's the [ash key 00:07:16] table? Ash key. I'm just going to do lower case letters. [crosstalk 00:07:39] "
"There probably is. If you do it outside, yeah, if you-"
"Yeah, do it in the class. "
For character or like what characters do you want? 
All right. 
"That's done. All right, I finished the character aim. It was really simple. It was literally the same thing as the [ant 00:08:38] area. I take out that and change your RA to character and change... and put that next to Math.random and then pass it through. "
"Yeah, basically what I'm about to do is I'm just going to copy/paste this. Search character. So, yeah. Basically your body is going to stay the same. Yeah, you might have to change the... Huh, that's weird. M characters. Oh, wow. That's it? So I can filter M characters. [crosstalk 00:10:22]"
I need the-
"Oh, yeah. No, I did double. I don't think it matters there. "
Yeah.
Yeah. But I guess the other stuff we've done is basically the same structure. We just [crosstalk 00:11:20] different things from that structure. Because all these go through every element and the [range 00:11:27]. 
So I'm actually done. [crosstalk 00:11:49] 
"Equals... yeah, yeah. "
It doesn't matter if we're-
It doesn't matter for methods. 
"Yeah. Return value. [crosstalk 00:12:54] All right, methods. All right, so if... [crosstalk 00:13:28]"
"Yeah, just [inaudible 00:15:03]. All right. "
I didn't hear it. 
For... I returned it. 
"I don't think it matters, though. "
All right. 
What? 
"Oh, wait. I don't need two. [inaudible 00:17:00] And then array, array plus two. Then [crosstalk 00:17:18] sum is two. "
"It's slightly more difficult than what we did before. Aw, man. I have to... "
Yeah. 
"Okay, search equals [inaudible 00:18:12]. [crosstalk 00:18:20] Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. I was doing something really stupid. "
Hold on. I was trying to do the second method when I was supposed to do the first. 
"So it's yeah, times 26. I think it was plus 61."
"Yep, that's what I put. "
"All right, that's good. "
"Oh, fuck. [crosstalk 00:22:16] Oh, okay. Yep. Mm-hmm (affirmative). [crosstalk 00:22:16] Does not equal 31 in this. [crosstalk 00:22:16] Nine. All right. I think I am done. One, one. Three, that's good. Two, two. Arrange. [inaudible 00:23:52] zero. At the top, lower 12. Ah. [crosstalk 00:24:12] "
"One, one. Wait. I'm going to search for A. All right. All right. I think that's it. I should probably output the arrays, though. "
Output the array. 
"Yeah. Wait, what? Where did my thing go? "
Control C. 
"Ah. Okay, so this is what I'm going to do. [inaudible 00:26:11] out to print. There should be... [crosstalk 00:26:25] Plus one space. Plus... [crosstalk 00:26:46] Okay, and then control C. "
Review. It looks [inaudible 00:27:12]. 
I had the wrong [ash key 00:27:12] values.
Yeah. Value. 
"I put the hedge value, not the decimal value. So it's actually 97. "
"Two and two. Two, three, four, five. Each side of this work here, everything is zero to three. Equal. Okay, yeah so I am done now. Yeah. "
"So, it's really the same thing as... Well you-"
"When you assign the value to I and J, I personally did it through the [inaudible 00:29:22]. "
"You can't return two values, so array one. Put this in there. "
And you're going to pass back [inaudible 00:29:45]. 
"No, no. "
This times two. 
Yeah. 
So value zero would be the I value. 
Yeah. Just put value. 
"Yeah. Oh, okay. Then you break and you go down. "
"Oh, I didn't put it. Dumb ass. In your outside folder-"
"So down here. No, one more. Then view it if index of search zero does not equal negative one."
"Yeah. No, you break. Yeah. "
You have to do it twice because if not it'll keep going to the folder. Down here-
"No, you don't. Yeah, this index search zero. "
You can in array. 
What?
I got it. It happened to me earlier. I put the wrong... I didn't have boxes in front of that and I was trying to return an array. 
The array...
Hmm?
"All this does is you break out of the second four loop, but that is going to break on its own if it's not in there. "
So you initialize your first initial search through negative one for both values. What'd you think of the test today?
Yeah. 
You had the whole page of determinants?
"You know, I'm pretty sure you can type it into your calculator, like, to get it so that a determinant equals five. I had five.  "
"Yeah, AAC and II. "
Yeah. 
I only screwed up on the times 10. 
"Yeah, at first I was going to put 150-"
Yeah. 
"Yeah, so it was 5000, I think. "
Yeah.
"Yeah, five times 10 to the third. "
"All right, good. I don't think it was as bad as the last test."
Really?
I struggled. [crosstalk 00:35:11] Yeah. I didn't do good on the last one. How'd you do on the first one?
That's what I did. I don't know. I think this one should be-
Yeah. I'm not too sure on some of the basis stuff. 
Yeah. 
"Yeah, the column space is the one I had a bit of trouble. "
"Yeah, I think I accidentally did the null space twice on one of the [platforms 00:36:06]."
But it shouldn't be that bad. 
Yeah. 
"Nah, I think-"
Differential equations was harder. Top [two 00:36:29] was harder. 
Next semester. 
Really?
"I had AP stats back in high school and it was all calculator. It's basically linear algebra, but with instead of the matrix functions, you scale it to-"
"Averages, means, medians, stuff like that. "
All right. I have-
Cool. All right.
