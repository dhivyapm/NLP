"That should be good, all right.",
So they need to choose either one-,
"Yeah, so the menu is there.",
"If one, then they want square. So we're going to do ... We ask them for the dimensions of the square. So what-",
"Yeah, so ask them, ""What's the length of the side?""",
"Yeah, so we're only going to ask them for one side. Then we're going to store that. Let's call it X.",
Then it prints what the output is.,
"This one's for the square. We're still on the square, right? So two is for the rectangle, so let's do that one next.",
What's the length of the side?,
"No, I'm just showing [crosstalk 00:02:32].",
"Right, it's showing the method.",
"Right, exactly. So this is behind the scenes, if that makes sense. So then we ask them for two variables for the length and the width of the rectangle.",
"That's okay. I'm just sketching it quickly, so that we can program it. If triangle ...",
So this is if they said square.,
Yeah. I think that's a switch statement right there.,
You're putting in more detail than I am.,
"Well, so we need to map out what each method would look like next.",
Yeah. So write four methods to get dimensions of each shape.,
"Yeah, let's just do it on the page.",
So triangle and a circle.,
"I'm just thinking. I guess we need to use double, right?",
"We need to use double or integer? No, double.",
Yeah.,
"All right, are you ready?",
All right.,
Yeah.,
"You have to connect them, right?",
So this one goes here. This one also goes here. This one goes here. This one goes here.,
You did?,
So let's try-,
That's okay.,
So we want to do a new class. Is it working?,
This is activity 14?,
"Wow, we've come a long way.",
"Before you create it, make sure that you don't have any of these checked.",
"Because when you're creating your own method, you don't want to have this.",
Pretty sure.,
"It says, ""Write four methods to get dimensions for each shape,"" right?",
"Well, it's a combination of them. But let's just try it that. I'll make a new [crosstalk 00:11:13].",
Sure.,
I think so.,
"Yeah, I'll just write it in and do it like this.",
"First, we want to write a switch statement, right?",
"No, first we want to start the scanner.",
"Now we've got to give them the menu options, right?",
Yeah? So menu options are choose-,
"Square, rectangle, triangle, and ... What was the last one? Circle.",
Hm?,
"Oh, sure. We could.",
"All right, we'll do that later then. So then we want to store the input. So it's a string, right? So-",
It said in the guidelines to do it that way.,
"Yeah, you're right. Let me reread that instruction. User input can be either an uppercase or lowercase or mixed. That means we can't use a switch or we could convert it once they-",
"Yeah, I think you're right.",
"Yep, so let's do that. So string input equals ...",
"Just to get ... So we've asked them to enter their options, so we need to store what they answer.",
"We don't know. It could be anything. They'll type it in though. They'll type in the word square or the word rectangle, and it might be uppercase-",
I didn't put one. I just put square.,
"No, it's string. Input dot next line.",
"Equals square, yeah. That works.",
"Square? But we need to also do ... There's a different method that we need. It's not just equals. It's like regardless of whether it's a uppercase or lowercase, we want it to do this.",
"It's not two uppercase or two lowercase. Equals ignore case ... That's what we want, we want that one. Equals ignore case.",
"Choice dot equals ignore case. Can you remind me again, is it capitalized?",
"Wait, it's not working. Is that in quotations-",
"Oh, sorry. I've forgotten these.",
"Wait. No, it's not working.",
"It's not. There should be something before it though. Usually it's something dot equals, isn't it?",
"Well, why don't we try both? Have them both there. I got it, it's this one. So you have choice dot equals ignore case, no dot and then choice in parentheses.",
That's good. If it equals ... What?,
So this can't be choice anymore. It needs to be ...,
"Square, yeah.",
"Yeah, I think it does.",
"So then if they've chosen square, we need to print what's the length of the side.",
Yeah. Is it going to work if we don't start the scanner over again? Let's try it.,
"Length equals input dot next, double.",
"No, I thought so, but it doesn't need it.",
"Yeah. All right, so now we've got that number.",
"Oh, sorry.",
Why?,
I'll just say side then. How's that?,
Side or sides.,
So now we want to do square ...,
"This is where we need to put the method in. Well, we need to write a method.",
"Yeah, the calculation is for a square, right? So a square is just the beginning. We say we want it to be a double.",
Do what?,
Right here?,
"That's calling the method, but we need to create the method below, so that it'll print that, right?",
No.,
"So now we need to do the calculation for a square, which is ...",
It's all right.,
"Double area equals side times side, right? Return area.",
I'm confused.,
Let me see.,
"I think it's all good, but there might be something wrong. We might need to call it X instead of side. Is that okay?",
"All right, so we're trying to ...",
"Yeah, you're right.",
It's probably because it needs to be a variant of ...,
It could be.,
All right.,
Which one?,
This one up here?,
"I think it should be here and that there should also be a line that says print it, right? This should be side. Area, right? I have no idea.",
Yeah.,
Right.,
"So it should just be the method signature, is that what you mean?",
"So we'll just say square, no.",
I did something wrong. What do you think? Double result equals square and side.,
"Square side? Oh, you want me to change it?",
"So this stored the variable. Then this is the method that's supposed to create the area of the square, right?",
Does everything in this look good?,
"Double area equals ... Oh, maybe I need parentheses.",
Around this.,
"Oh, it did. That helped.",
I don't know why. Also why is there-,
Double result.,
Should we make it result instead of area? It shouldn't matter what we name it.,
You have to have a return.,
"This should really be double area, right? Or is it result? Then this could be side? Doesn't matter what we do here.",
Do you think it's because we're using words instead of numbers?,
It's not thinking of this as a number somehow.,
Put it in parentheses?,
"No, it shouldn't matter. Oh, maybe it's because I have a bracket in the wrong spot. Oh, I took out a bracket and that helped.",
We're going to need it to open. No.,
I think the whole method needs to go at the bottom. That's the wrong ...,
"No, it need to be way at the bottom, I think.",
"Yeah, there we go. Perfect. I think that'll work. Should we try it?",
"Really we won't get anything right now because it's kind of unfinished, right? Yeah, can't start it.",
"Oh, okay. Square. No, didn't work. We don't have a loop.",
"We need to have a loop, right?",
This needs to be looping.,
"Yeah, I'm just kind of talking, I guess. Oh, this needs to be in a print statement. That's why. Oh, there, it's got a system.",
Let's just do print. That might do it.,
"Yes, it did it.",
All right.,
What do you mean?,
"Oh, sure, that's a good idea. I'll change this. Math dot-",
The side.,
"I'm just going to delete this. Oh, you're right. It needs another-",
"The formula for a square is the side times the side. So if they enter ... Oh, you're right. I'll stop talking.",
"No, that's good. I like your idea.",
"Oh, it's where you have square there. It should be square side.",
Yeah.,
"Yep, right there too because they're calling the method there. Oh, so there's two different things here, right? There's square, which is the name of the method. There's square side, which is what you've called the input. So actually that one needs to be square. That one needs to be square [crosstalk 00:37:05].",
"Oh, it's probably just the brackets. Add a bracket here, a close bracket. I mean brace, closed. Just get rid of that. Then get rid of one down here. There we go, awesome.",
So now we need to do a different if statement.,
"So this part at the bottom is just the method. So in terms of our ifs, we still need to put the three other options in between here.",
Yeah.,
"Do you think after that brace there ... So it's another if, right? So if choice dot [crosstalk 00:38:25]. Rectangle and then open brackets, open braces. Wait, you don't want that. That's good. Then it's the exact same thing basically. We could just use that.",
"Yeah, oops.",
"Well, repeat this exact thing. Just change it from length of side to length of side and length of width.",
Right.,
Yeah.,
We need to store two variables.,
That's all right. I get it.,
"Wait, wait, wait. You're ahead of me.",
"We're not done yet, are we?",
Which leg?,
"So again, let's just put a method right here, just like this one, and put it right after this.",
"So basically we're stashing a new method at the bottom, right?",
"No, outside of it. Just its own unit.",
"Yeah. One is closing your if statement and the other one is closing the [crosstalk 00:41:36], I think.",
"Yeah, that's good. But we need to change the name.",
"Rectangle, the whole side.",
"Yeah, it's going to do that for a little while because we need to build the method.",
Yep. This is just length times width.,
Are you getting an error? What'd I do? It must be too many brackets.,
It's probably my brackets.,
How many do you have?,
I'll get rid of that one and this one.,
"Double result equals rectangle and then length, width.",
Then ...,
"You have to print it, right?",
That's not working.,
What'd I do?,
Put what right here?,
"Oh, it's not applicable. It's double, double. I guess I didn't-",
"Oh, you're right.",
Down there?,
Oh.,
"That's a good catch, that helped.",
All right.,
"Yeah, now we've got to do triangle.",
So another if-,
"Well, it might be different this time.",
I'll try.,
"Yeah, looks good.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
Height and base.,
"The base has to be smaller than the height, right? No?",
Then that's fine. Just shows how much math I know.,
It shows how much math I know.,
We need to write this method.,
We need to write the method for it.,
"Well, it's going to do different things. But it starts out similar.",
"Just below it, yeah.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
I'm getting errors.,
Yeah.,
This is good.,
No. I've got a lot of problems. I think it's because of my brackets.,
What's the formula for the triangle?,
All of it divided by two?,
I'll try that.,
This is going to need another one on the side.,
Just so it's enclosed.,
[crosstalk 00:48:17],
"No, I still got an error up here.",
It's another one maybe. What'd I do up here?,
"Double base, double height. That's good, right?",
"Base cannot be resolved to a variable, oh.",
"I think I forgot to declare it up here. Oh, see, it's right here. This should say base and height.",
"But it doesn't, hang on.",
"Last one, we have this.",
Circle.,
Enter a number for the radius.,
We still have the audio.,
"Yeah, but she said raise your hand if you have it. Oh, well.",
Is it working?,
Number four.,
Thank you.,
"No, I don't see anything. Guess we don't have to do anything.",
"Yeah, I know.",
I'm kidding.,
Do you think we just need to refresh?,
"It's down here somewhere probably. There it is, all right.",
Yep.,
Good.,
"All right, let's just read through it. Develop string method.",
We need to develop a program that gets a string and counts the number of vowels in the string.,
"Write step by step pseudocode for this program. Have it as the block comma to your code. All right, so that's the first step. Then draw the flow chart, then develop the program. So you want to open a program, and we'll just write the pseudocode.",
Activity 16 this time.,
We'll call it question one.,
That's okay.,
"All right, new class.",
"Oh, are we supposed to?",
"Oh, okay.",
Pseudocode.,
Version. Why do you have an asterisk?,
It's just happening.,
"All right. So we need to use a scanner to get a string, right?",
Yeah.,
"Yeah, let's call it sentence. How's that?",
I'm just doing that. We don't need to.,
"Then I think the only other thing before we make methods would be call the vowel-find method, right?",
Find vowel method. Count vowels? Is there two steps in there?,
"I think we should put that in a method. So in this portion, we should say just call the method.",
We'll just say call method which counts vowels. How's that?,
Now we have to write the method.,
So then begin method.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
Begin method.,
We need to explain what the parameters are.,
"I guess it's a string, right? [crosstalk 00:57:50]",
Do you want it to be a void method or a value-returning method?,
"All right, so begin a method, which ...",
... Takes in a string and counts the vowels?,
All right. Then I would say do a loop that checks the index of each ... The character H index. Start loop.,
"Yeah, all right. Good enough, right?",
"All right, do you feel ready to do a program?",
"Oh, we need a flowchart.",
We're not?,
"Oh, return.",
Number of vowels.,
Return the number of vowels?,
Yeah.,
"All right, so [crosstalk 01:00:11] extra paper. Let's use some of this if you have a pen.",
"Oh, I don't know. Here.",
"Thank you, fancy. It's hard to write. It starts with the oval, right?",
"No, hold on.",
Thanks.,
Here.,
How's that?,
"Oh, the instructions. They're right here. All right, the first thing is to take in the sentence.",
So prompt the user for a sentence. So type a sentence?,
That is in a statement. Then we just need to store it. Let's call it S for simplicity's sake.,
SC.,
"S, okay. S equals input.",
All right. I feel like it's more useful to look at our pseudocode here. So prompt user to enter a sentence. Call the method.,
How do you do a flowchart?,
I don't think there were any flowcharts.,
The method is down here.,
So we really just need to call it. So let's call it vowel count. How's that?,
Not yet.,
"No, maybe not.",
Is it still plugged in?,
"Then we'll write the method down here, right?",
That's the name of the method.,
"Yeah, and that's where it's going to-",
Yeah.,
"Well, I made a counter.",
I think so. It's part of the method.,
"Well, so they're not going to be connected because this is really just connected by an invisible line. So this is the signature for the method, right?",
"So if you [crosstalk 01:08:52], you're calling this method. But they're not physically connected.",
Yeah.,
"Oh, okay, let's do that. Should we just turn it off while we're taking the quiz?",
"While we take the quiz, should we just turn it off?",
"As long as we don't talk while we're taking the quiz, it's good. I can't see-",
I can't read that far.,
I wouldn't have known.,
Is it how many different methods? Or-,
I thought it was six.,
Got like a zero.,
"Okay, so let's quickly write this method and then we can code it. Do you want to use a four or a while?",
While.,
"Actually, in the flow chart I guess it doesn't really matter, huh? Cause we're basically saying as long as the counter-",
Yeah.,
Less than length.,
We'll just connect these to yourselves.,
Length.,
"Yeah, I'll wait if you wanna.",
I put counter because we're counting something later on and I don't want to get confused.,
You got it?,
"Yep, and then I'm saying, ""If yes, we're gonna have to do a really big-""",
"No we need to get the SI, whatever it's called, for all vowels. So in the flow chart maybe we can just write as long as it's either A or I or U. Cause we're trying to find all of the vowels.",
"We're gonna need two because we need to say, ""While the index-",
"Yeah, it's gonna be a loop.",
"I think there's a couple of steps here. So let's make a new counter and call it ""X"".",
"So, this loop here is kind of like the large wild loop. And we wanna make some smaller loops inside, right? So here's a smaller counter that we can use for this next loop.",
If the character at the index of-,
"Well we don't mean the index, we mean the character at the index of, right. So we're going to do ""char at"" and this one would be ""X"", equals ...",
We'll just put the vowels for now. We'll figure the code out later.,
And Y maybe.,
There's a debate about Y.,
"So if it does equal this, then we want to increase the counter, right? We need a new counter then.",
Because we're using this counter for this loop. And we're using this counter for this one.,
This is the method.,
You mean easier to do this first.,
Yeah.,
"Let's just say ""number of vowels equals"" ... something like that. ""Number of vowels, plus plus"".",
No I don't think so.,
"Yeah, so we'll say if it gets to here, make the vowels bigger. How's that? So this is yes. We'll make no coming off this way, I guess. Like in an L or something.",
Program? You're right.,
"Yeah, you're right.",
I think we need to say-,
That's it.,
"There's a problem with this, cause right now it would do it once. So we need to make X bigger here. X plus plus.",
"Yeah, but we need to make sure that X goes one higher next time so that it's checking the index after that.",
But make sure you're making X bigger too.,
"No, that's a different thing. That's the number of vowels.",
"Alright, that should do it.",
So how do we ... I'm lost.,
If this isn't-,
Okay.,
"This will read the first character in the sentence, and if it's an A or an I or an O or an E or a U it will then make the counter go up one.",
Yeah.,
Do we?,
"Okay, then let's not. Let's just try and code it. Do this again.",
Do you wanna just stack those here for a minute? Or I'll put it here so you can see it while you code.,
The flowchart?,
So I'm just gonna start by importing the scanner.,
Did he do it already? Did he finish it already?,
"Okay, string S equals input dot line.",
"Yeah, let's just ... well, I mean it's not gonna actually do anything yet, but ...",
"Might just have to put S in there. Like, the name of the method and then-",
"Vowel count, yeah.",
"Yeah, and you might want to capitalize Count. ... So now let's try to figure out the method. We can fix that part later.",
Oh yeah. String S. And then open braces.,
I don't think so. So now I think we need to declare the counter.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative),
I feel worried about-,
"Let's just keep trying and see if it comes out,",
I'm not sure.,
First lets get the length.,
"Okay, that's what I got to. Now we need the while.",
While counter is less than length.,
Is it less than or equal to or is it just less?,
"Or equal? Okay, I'm changing that. And then don't forget to open braces.",
"But we don't want it to cause it starts from zero, right?",
So let's do not equals. We'll find out later when we test it.,
Yep. And now let's declare X.,
"Yeah, cause we're gonna start a new loop. This is where we need to get the ASTII codes for these letters.",
"Yeah, do you have that sheet? Or should I look it up?",
Should write that down somewhere.,
"There we go. So we need lower case ... oh shoot, we need it regardless of case.",
"Ignore case, yeah.",
But we need to be able to do X slash U and then the number that it has to do with it. So let's take the range of capital A to-,
We only want vowels though. So we're gonna need specific-,
"Can't we do a statement that's like, ""If the character at the index of one is A, or is I, or is U"".",
"It doesn't sound fun, but I feel like it's the only way.",
Like a [Bowlian 01:36:11] variable? Sounds good. Let's do that. Cause it will be too long.,
"We'll call it ""Bowlian is vowel."" How's that?",
It's inside the first loop.,
I don't think it really matters as long as it's high enough up that it's not to late.,
"What's the number for A? Lowercase, maybe.",
I don't know. Maybe not.,
"I want the next value, so I? E?",
65. And-,
Okay. And-,
6F.,
We haven't gotten to those questions yet. So let's not worry.,
75,
"Wait a minute, this is capitals. Do we have to do another one for-",
"Oh, so we need to do another one for capitals, right?",
I guess we can't do that.,
I don't think so.,
What am I supposed to be doing?,
We don't yet. We want to check-,
I don't think so.,
"Yeah, this is definitely a new loop here, and this is a loop, but then this is a loop.",
If the character at index of zero.,
Dot char at.,
Just put X.,
Did you declare an X?,
I would put that back in there. And X. Declare X.,
Well if char at X is equal to ... and then we need all of the vowels. Let me try and paste this in and see if this part works down there. Cause that's really what you need right here.,
"It works, so I don't think we can declare it up here.",
No.,
"You know what, now it doesn't work. Now that I got rid of that. So we can't-",
U. 0061.,
"Great, so I probably should just not have these parenthesis.",
What else did I do wrong here?,
Cause the Or is not working.,
Make that the whole hand. That's a good idea. So let's copy this whole part.,
Bowlian is vowel ... this probably needs to be in parenthesis again.,
"Yeah, this isn't working.",
"Oh, are we supposed to say, ""is equal to?""",
What? There's an error?,
"X in error, cause I've got my X higher up and it's still not working.",
I think we need to do-,
I know what we should do. We should do this.,
Call it-,
"Yeah, can we convert it into an integer by doing this? Look, you can convert it into an integer.",
"Cause then it might be allowed to be in here. Like, if you say ""equals"" ... no, I don't know.",
Maybe this needs more parentheses.,
Oh I see. That makes sense.,
"Okay. So, wait what kind of variable.",
Is it? I thought it was a character.,
Sorry.,
Character.,
"Okay. Wait? CH equals s.char x, but this is going to need to be in the method. No. This isn't good.",
"I think you're on to something, I just need to -",
Let me organize here. There you go. That works.,
"I just moved the x to higher up, and so this one's working now. I think that's good.",
X is what's going into this.,
And put it higher up.,
Okay.,
And then create this character.,
Yeah. That's good. Right there.,
Yeah.,
"Yeah, and then put x and then parentheses there.",
Let's see. Oh.,
Yeah.,
I don't remember what I'm doing here.,
It's late. Okay. CH equals these.,
"Hm? [inaudible 01:48:01] Oh. Six, nine and six f.",
Yeah. Six nine.,
"0069, sorry.",
"Six f. Okay, and don't forget there's a zero before the six.",
And then 0075. Okay.,
"Now, this has to be like or CH.",
Let's see if I get any errors. Yep.,
Nice.,
That's awesome. Okay. [crosstalk 01:49:40] An if.,
"Wait. What? I had while. This should be if. Hang on. Okay, and then we really don't need anything else. Right?",
We do? Wait.,
"Okay. So if this is true, we need to make the number vowels variable go up, but we haven't declared it yet so before the x equals zero, put a number of vowels integer.",
"No, it's this whole new thing. Right? So vowel counts is the name of our method, so we can't use that one.",
Number of vowels. I wonder why I'm having an error up here now.,
Oh. I think it' the brackets. There's not enough of them.,
Hm.,
"Number of vowels can equal zero, and then -",
Great. We'll worry about it in a sec. First let's -,
"Yeah, so return . . . wait. First we need to make number of vowels go up. And then we need to return it. Return.",
We can't do it in two steps.,
Yeah.,
Oh the method must return a result of type integer. It is. Why are they?,
"They already are, so we've said if this character happens to be a vowel but then make this number higher, right? So that should be good.",
"But we might need an else, because it's not that then what is it going to return?",
"Right, so we need to put else. Return. With nothing. Right? Can we do that? Just return nothing?",
"I think we forgot to make the counter change, because the counter needs to get bigger now. Right?",
Counter plus plus. That fixed it. [crosstalk 01:53:58]. Yeah. Okay.,
"Well, because of the big loop. The bigger loop needs to change, right?",
"Oh you were on number one? Oh, you're right. There's only one. No. Okay. See this is going to keep running for forever, because the counter hasn't changed.",
Okay.,
"[crosstalk 01:55:05]. Oh. Maybe we take this off? [crosstalk 01:55:21] We'll finish it later, right?",
Fourteen.,
No. We're not done.,
Yeah. Okay.,
Okay.,
Yeah.,
I know now. I mean.,
Yeah. I think this needs to be - I don't know.,
There. [crosstalk 02:01:10],
Okay we need to show the value and it's index so let's print it here.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
I'm still getting the zeroes. This is bad.,
I don't know.,
You're getting numbers? Okay.,
Yes.,
No yours is good. Very good.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
I do?,
Oh.,
Okay. Let me try that. There. It's working.,
But it should only show the max.,
It's not working. This one's working.,
Oh no.,
Alright so the answer to that is that this needs to be outside of the [inaudible 02:02:54] right? Let's try that. Six is the max.,
"Well, I printed over here. Hang on. [crosstalk 02:03:10] Source I.",
"And then put that on the outside, right? Okay. Let's try that.",
"Oh. Wait. I said nine. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, ten. Ah. [inaudible 02:04:11].",
"Oh. And I think this needs to be minus one. [inaudible 02:04:11] No. That was just the max printing right. Wait a minute. 1, 2, 3.",
"4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yeah. It's working. I just didn't. Let's try it this way. Can't do that? Okay let's try the five. There we go.",
Yeah. You want to write these two?,
Yeah.,
I'll think about the next one.,
"It's kind of like setting the maximum to zero, and it's for the first index.",
Does that help?,
I don't think it works without the zero. Do you want me to test it?,
Okay.,
"They want us to show the value and the index, so we need to change this to not just show -",
"For this loop, you only want to run until it finds the final answer, and then you want it to print the answer after the fact. But for this one, you want it to print every time it loops. Doe that help?",
I tried that. It didn't work.,
"Yeah. Cool. I have a question. Is it better to use one loop and do everything in one loop, or do you need separate loops for each like a,b,c,d? Or does it depend?",
Oh. How do I close . . . there.,
Alright. Sorry about that.,
"Okay. 'Cause we've got the you know, this is basically answering a.",
"Can we in theory, use that same loop to do some of thSpeaker 9:",Yeah. [inaudible 02:06:54].
Okay. [crosstalk 02:06:54]. Alright.,
"Okay, but it wouldn't work if you just started doing the things in the same loop like just put right in there the something?",
That answers that. Thanks. [crosstalk 02:07:27] Okay.,
Yeah. Let's not do that. We can't do that.,
"I'm just copying this first loop, so that we can work faster.",
"Now, how do I change this though cause we don't want that, right? We want something else to happen.",
"Okay. Okay. Alright. I've made some empty loops here. Okay. So, in this one we want to add - [crosstalk 02:08:29].",
Oh. It doesn't seem to care.,
Yeah. You're right. Let's use a different one. Let's use k. What should we use for the fourth loop?,
Okay.,
Oh.,
Yours is working.,
Okay. Alright.,
Great.,
That's fine. Alright.,
Okay. [inaudible 02:10:03].,
Yeah. I think so. Alright. Enter number.,
"In the print line. You did the new line, but you didn't say max. Put max in there. [crosstalk 02:10:35].",
Oh. Are we supposed to do from ten to a hundred. I thought we were doing from - oh shoot. I need to change that. Okay.,
"Okay. Why does the line have to be so large? We definitely shouldn't print it, because that would be to long.",
I'm taking that line out. I don't want to print it anymore. I'm gonna print the maximum.,
Let me try. It's working.,
"Oh max equals source. You need to decore max before you use it in that if statement. Wait, no that's not right. It looks the same as mine. Doesn't it?",
That's so weird and there's no restates.,
Yeah. Try again.,
There you go.,
Alright.,
"Yeah. I'm intimidating. So if you can, make some of those empty loops so that we can work with them.",
I don't know. Oh.,
"Yeah. We finished B, we're on C now.",
The next loop?,
"Yeah. So, there's two steps in making the average. First we need to get the total of all the numbers added together, and then divide it by how many numbers there are. Right?",
So this loop will get us the total and then we'll divide it.,
"Yeah. I'm calling it inch though, because we don't have any doubles. Is it still recording?",
Yeah. Okay.,
Okay.,
Yeah. I put it before the loop.,
And then we only really need one line in the loop.,
So that it adds every number up to -,
"Yeah, but that would have to be outside the loop, right?",
'Cause we need to get all of the numbers together and then go outside the loop to do the average.,
Yeah. Sorry.,
"All the numbers, no way. [crosstalk 02:15:34]. Oh. That's not a semi-colon, it's a colon. There you go. [crosstalk 02:16:07]",
"Yeah. No, the average. Oh I did one line before that to get the average here.",
Yeah.,
"Well [crosstalk 02:16:25]. No, 'cause the loop inside is doing things repetitively, and we only want it to do one thing.",
Yeah. You're doing good.,
"Well, I'm worried because total and n are both integers, so if we don't tell it that we want the division to do like precise things, don't you think we'd need to?",
"So the numbers are 2, 2, and three and three. The average is 2.5.",
"Well, why don't we have it print 2.5.",
Okay. Let me test it and see how it goes.,
Oh. I gotta do my new line going here.,
'Cause that looks really bad.,
"I'm gonna swap where the new line goes. [crosstalk 02:17:59]. It's because you write j twice. Oh no, it's working. That's awesome.",
Nice.,
Looks good.,
"Alright. So, now we're on d. Find the elements that have a higher values than average value. [inaudible 02:18:35]. Yeah. Let's use - [inaudible 02:18:36]. Yeah. We're just doing that one right? So, let's just start another loop.",
"This is where I don't know. I think what you want to do is an if inside here that says if this number, whatever it is is -",
"Yeah. Greater than average and we might need to [inaudible 02:19:20] declare the average so that average up here, and now we've got it in a loop, so we need to just pull it through somehow don't we? [inaudible 02:19:35]. Oh. Okay. So, if it's higher, we want to send it into a new array which means we need to declare a new array, so let's declare it up here. What should we call it?",
High values.,
Oh. Okay. This isn't -,
"Okay. This isn't the right way to do this. It's like that, right?",
Okay. How's that?,
Yeah.,
Oh.,
"Right. Wait, I can't quite read that.",
The same type and size. So let's make it a size up here too. Let's say-,
Inch.,
Can't we say it's N? Because they told us the size is gonna be N.,
"For this loop, you need to create a new LA with the same type and size of source array. So it's gotta be the same size.",
So now what goes in there? I don't know.,
Imagine this number is bigger than average. We need to make a new variable? Or put it into that one?,
"So how do you put it into it? Like high values L. Yeah, that's it. That makes sense, but we need it to keep doing that.",
Really?,
"Sorry, I'm distracted. Can we use this one? Because we're copying it into it. So maybe in this part, instead of doing that whole step, we could do it in baby steps, like here just store the values somehow.",
Okay. Can we say-,
Do you think that would work?,
Okay. I gotta print it way down here I think.,
Yeah.,
Okay. What do I have [crosstalk 02:23:20] again?,
That's why we're a team right?,
"Actually, that might be too far out of the loop. Let me try it a little bit farther up. I don't know if this is gonna work out. The average is 3.9, and then this is printing what? Every single number, right? That's not what we want. We only want it to print if it's larger than-",
"Oh, so I do need to take it lower down.",
I think we actually might want ... No. It's something about the L.,
"Well, I can't.",
"Well, this needs to be ... Oh, we can't print it at all, because we have to print an array, which means we have to have another loop.",
Yeah. How do you do a printing loop again? I gotta remember. Displaying arrays. We need to use this entire loop to print-,
So let's do that.,
You are useful.,
Yeah. Did you use K though?,
Okay.,
"Oh, this is still not working, because I can't print L. I have to print B. Okay. I'm gonna try this just to see if it's working. Okay?",
"It's not working. Oh, actually it is. Nevermind. Wait. The average is six, so it only printed things that are higher than six.",
I think that's because we didn't put anything in those values. Like in those indexes. It's just they just feel it to zero.,
Error?,
"Oh, the array. Yeah, this is the high values array. You can see none of the numbers are smaller than six unless you count the zeros. I think the zeros are just placeholders.",
Shuffle. Random shuffling. That's our next step.,
"Yeah, right here?",
It looks hard.,
It looks hard. I think this part is kind of like the ... Remember the 10th value to swap the places of two? It's just the same exact thing.,
Okay.,
"I'm gonna put a comment in for each loop, so that we can remember what we're doing.",
Whoops sorry.,
Yeah.,
"Did you already do ... Yeah, right here.",
"This is to print the array, but you don't have to do that. It didn't say to. Like you could not do any of that, and you'd be fine. You're good. So instead, let's do a new loop with M.",
Yeah.,
Two down. Yeah.,
"Yeah, that's good.",
Right.,
"Yeah, that's the one. That's basically what I wrote. So ... Now, I'm noticing something. This is not okay. It's gonna go too far. Oops.",
So let's do minus one. How's that?,
"And then this one, source.",
"Yeah. So that we can randomly shuffle it based on a random number. Do we need to ... I think this, since it has two loops kind of, you need two different variables, so I'm gonna use M, and then I'm gonna change this one to-",
"No, we can't use N. We've already used N. Let's say S. Okay. So S is our-",
"No, it won't let us do that.",
Oh. I don't know. It's got an error.,
Oh. Why would they want me to have that there?,
Wait. I'm here.,
"Int. Yeah, no. So I don't need the bracket. I just need that.",
That's alright.,
Good.,
"Yeah, which is S, right? Now, I'm still using M.",
"Okay, so this little piece here, is like the equivalent of us calling a variable like X, right? And this is the equivalent of Y. So I made a temporary variable, and I set it to X. Now I'm setting X to Y, and then I'll set Y to the temp, and that will have swapped the places of those two numbers.",
"But since they're actually calling parts of an array, we're just switching two numbers in two different arrays. In one array, right?",
"In one array. And we don't know which two numbers, because it's a random number called S.",
"We're not shuffling the index. We're only shuffling the numbers that are at those places, right?",
That's not right though. It's giving me an error.,
"I think it's because I used double, and these numbers are actually integers. Yeah. That's it.",
"I'm just making a note so I don't forget why we did this, because I'm very close to that point.",
To forget why I'm doing these things.,
"Okay. So that's ... Wait, let's go back.",
I don't think so. Okay. Are we on F? Yeah.,
"This is gonna be hard. What are we gonna call it? Oh, target.",
"So first, let's just name it. Baby steps, right? So I'm going outside of that loop.",
I think so.,
[inaudible 02:36:52] okay. Let's name this one int target.,
"Wait, I thought we had to name it target.",
Okay. Alright. So that's created.,
"Yeah, because it said it needs to be the same size.",
Okay. Now copy the first half of the source array into the second half. Alright.,
Shifting elements. We might need to use this.,
Why?,
I see.,
"Can't we just ... We can do divided by N, because N is our length of-",
Okay. So-,
"Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Wait, no.",
"No, that's not right.",
"Well, let's make a loop, and we'll have to use what? Like Q now.",
I've already used I.,
I've already used I.,
Really?,
Oh. I feel silly now.,
Okay.,
Yeah.,
Okay.,
"Now, it's not working. I think we need new ones.",
"Oh, okay. Gotcha. Alright. So now we have a loop. And we've got a new array. So we want to make sure to put-",
"You're right. How's this look to you? If we put it right in there, this thing will only loop as much as half the length.",
So and then if we set this to start at ... And wait.,
"Yeah, it is. Target is set to N, right? So this is the equivalent of N divided by two. So is that good?",
"Alright. But we don't want it to put this into the first half, so we're gonna have to set this instead of to zero ... Wait, no. I think it's nested loops. Oh, what if you did ... If Q-",
Greater [crosstalk 02:41:40].,
What if we set it to the same thing? Like can we do this?,
"Okay. And N, we want to put them into it, so we'll say the new thing into the old thing, right? So-",
"Target, can't type. And this is Q?",
Source.,
Not Q?,
I feel like it should be Q.,
"Wait, so are we supposed to print it?",
They must want us to print it. I'm gonna take this print thing and change it to fit.,
"I am printing it, but I think we have to have a new loop to do that. So instead of high values, we want this to be target?",
Oh. Let me see if it works.,
No.,
"It was close, but it's not right.",
"Mm-hmm (negative). So look, you can only put them into the second half. So shouldn't the first three be zeros? Or the first like seven should be zeros?",
"Yeah, there's 11 numbers. So it should be zero zero zero up to at least four, and then the rest should be numbers, but I've got the reverse. So it's backwards.",
Zero two?,
Other half.,
Maybe I should say if Q is less than. Let me try that. Nope. It was better the other way.,
"Oh, I know why. It's because we changed it when we made the high values thing. Didn't we change it? Maybe not. Nevermind. Alright, so this is clearly not doing the trick. Maybe we need to shift the elements.",
Yeah.,
"Yeah. You've gotta subtract. I tried it right in here. No, that didn't work.",
Isn't that what I had?,
"Right here. N is the length, right? So I tried that and it didn't work. So now maybe we should try doing this.",
Actually-,
Wait. Wait. Minus that. And then when we print it ... I don't understand why I've got a temp here.,
Should I try it?,
"Yeah. No, I mean, I named it temp two, so it should be fine.",
"I think we're just trying to do too much at once. It might be something that we should do in two steps, like two loops. Probably won't change anything. No. Maybe we can declare this variable, target dot length divided by two.",
"I am using target, but I thought maybe we needed to use this shifting elements technique to get them not to start at zero.",
"Yeah, I know",
No. No no no.,
"No no. But that's okay. Let me go back. Let's simplify, right?",
Middle.,
Why can't we set it to the middle? I definitely don't need this.,
"Okay, I don't need this one. So just to try and simplify, I named this middle so that we don't have to keep putting that in.",
"But so the loop is from Q, the Q is the middle. And as long as it's less than the middle ... See, that's the problem, because it's not less than the middle.",
"It should be as long as it's less until the length, right?",
"And then we don't really even need that. Well, I guess it's fine. No, we don't need that.",
It made it more complicated. Okay.,
I don't know.,
"Yay, it's working.",
I put 10 in yeah.,
"Yeah, should I run it again?",
"Okay. One, two, three, four, five. Yep, looks good.",
I'm just gonna put a couple comments in while you keep going.,
"Oh my gosh, where are you?",
Target. Okay. Do you want this variable? Because it makes it easier.,
Oh.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
Yeah. Divided by two.,
Yeah. And then the rest of it looks good.,
No. It's more simple than we thought it was.,
Me too.,
"Yeah, and that's just the loop to print it.",
Yeah.,
This whole thing is to print it.,
"Because since it's an array, you have to use a loop to show everything in it.",
"Yeah, it worked for me.",
Yeah. You can use I if you want.,
"A. Okay, that's cool. And then all you have to do is print it.",
"Yeah, you were.",
I don't know why I used line. I might get rid of that.,
Yeah. That's right.,
"So we're printing the target, but for you it's not B, right?",
"Yeah, A.",
"And space, yeah. We'll see if it works.",
I think there's a problem with a previous loop.,
Okay.,
Oh. Target Q equals source Q. Did you declare it up top?,
,
Declare it up top?,
Why'd you set it to 10?,
Maybe set it to the length of the ...,
I have N.,
We do it.,
"No, it doesn't say to. Did you want to get confirmation?",
"Yeah, I guess so. I'm going to put comments in.",
You do?,
"Yeah. I think it's because we put a line break in earlier on. If you scroll up, I'll bet you find that, backslash N.",
Hm?,
"This should be fast, right?",
"Yeah, don't want to make any mistakes.",
Yeah.,
It depends on what you're trying to print. But mostly yeah.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
I don't know. This doesn't work.,
"I've done something wrong. Oh, okay. All right.",
Where?,
What do you mean?,
Yeah.,
Source and then ...,
"Yeah. Wait, no. So listen, to print an array to show all of the numbers in it, you always have to have a loop.",
Yeah. So this is what it looks like right here. It always has this line with different whatever we're going to call it. Then it prints inside it.,
"Yeah, because this is the one where you want it to print every time it goes around, right?",
"So print the first one, the second one, all that.",
"All right, let me try.",
I've got to put this first. The first part of the print statement needs to be somewhere else because otherwise it says it every time. It shows a number. It needs to be before the loop. Does that make sense?,
It's going to be a pain though.,
Yeah. I wouldn't write 100 if I were you.,
Oh.,
You're funny.,
"Wait, wait. But since there's an if inside the loop, you want to go one lower to the outside of the full loop. Yeah, right there.",
Yeah.,
"Yeah. Let me see if I've got it now. Make sure to put a new line at the end of these or else, it's a problem.",
Where?,
"Right, because you need an entire loop to show that you're printing this entire array. So keep that line, it's good. Just put a loop around it, like four and then int B or whatever.",
Just make sure it doesn't go past the length of the array.,
"Yeah, the source length.",
I don't know. Is it?,
"Yeah, just put end brackets before the print and after the print. After that, yeah. There you go. That'll do it.",
"Oh, it's because it's L. You need to say B. So that's just bringing up ... The first loop, it's going to bring up the first number, the first number in the line. Second loop is going to bring up the second number. So if the first number is two and the second number is four, it'll print those.",
I think so.,
I think it's right. I'm so glad I studied.,
"Yeah, you don't have time.",
Yeah.,
I wouldn't say,
You'll get the hang of it.,
"Yeah, that's why I asked David, ""Are we supposed to do a new loop every time?"" I guess his answer was yes.",
Yeah.,
The post-lab and the pre-quiz.,
I don't know why this prints new lines all the time. Maximum number is a problem. I don't even remember where I put that. The maximum number is-,
"I'm having a problem where it's showing extra lines where it doesn't need to. Oh, it's this right here.",
"All right, I think we should-",
"Oh, I'm trying to make arrays.",
"All right, it should be 10, right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-",
"... Eight, nine, 10. Maximum is eight, that's right. Average is three, okay. Nothing's higher than three in here. Now they've shuffled the original array, so it's the same numbers as up here. It's just jumbled up. Then this looks pretty good.",
I think there's too many zeroes here because the original has zeroes in it.,
"Yeah, it looks good.",
"What's the problem? That's good. The nine is the maximum number, but you might want to put writing that say the maximum number is-",
"That would be just right here, after the N there.",
"Looks good. Then for the arrays, instead of doing a new line, maybe you should just do a space. So maybe instead of saying print line ...",
"Up there, yeah.",
"Yeah, and the thing that I discovered is if you want to write anything about this, you should write it before the loop. Otherwise, it'll tell you too many times.",
Yeah.,
Print.,
"I don't know, let me check. Midnight Friday. How are you doing?",
"Yeah, that looks good.",
"That's printing the array, but it's an array with only high values. So that's good.",
"If you want to write anything about it though, I'd recommend doing it before the loop.",
Yeah.,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
"Array, it doesn't really matter. It's just a description.",
Then change the line to just print and maybe add a space in between the numbers. Nice.,
"Yeah, it'll look good. Nice.",
"All right, you've got the high values. But you still need the final ... The shuffled one. Did you do the shuffled one?",
"Oh, you did.",
"No, you're missing two, the shuffled one and the last one.",
Yeah. You could probably copy the same loop.,
"It's going to be the same thing, right? So just take this whole two lines and the end bracket-",
And just copy it up to where you want it. Just change it a little bit.,
Where do you want it?,
"Yep, looks good. Then just change the name of which array you're printing.",
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
"Wait, no. It doesn't need to be S. Why?",
"Oh, I don't think it needs to be S because you already created the loop. You're just calling it ...",
"It still needs to be the same as that loop. No, it's fine. This is just to show-",
It's working for me with multiple of the same one. So I think it's fine.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
"Yeah, that's true.",
I'm going to fill out the exit form because this is working now.,
Yeah.,
Is it working?,
That's good. You just need to make sure there's a new line. So maybe-,
"Yeah, after the space, just do the ...",
"Yeah, that'll work.",
It didn't?,
"Oh, wait, take that back. I think that you need to do it in the loop that's printing. That's not the loop that's printing.",
"Here, right here.",
I don't think so.,
"Trial and error, right?",
Wait.,
"Wait a minute, what? Oh, I know. You want to start a new line before the number is on the array. So where do you see that? Up here. Put it right before the part-",
"No, right before.",
"Yeah. That'll do it. Wow, it looks perfect.",
What do you mean?,
The number on the array ... Different places.,
"If you're not sure which one you're on, maybe we can put comments in as we go, so that we know which loop does which.",
"Yeah, that's it right there.",
"April 2, 2019. What's your number?",
Four.,
All right.,
Ready?,
"All right, I'm clicking take quiz. Are you ready?",
"Yeah, it's time.",
Let's do it.,
All right.,
Yes.,
Okay.,
Yeah.,
Right. Match each part with the values of the array of the given line. I don't understand.,
"Oh, yeah. Part one is declaring the array.",
Array is set to a new array.,
No? Oh.,
[crosstalk 03:28:01],
[crosstalk 03:28:01],
Yeah.,
Then the next thing is calling the ...,
"Now before it's even initialized, it's calling the method.",
"Yeah, but array equals four basic math ops is a method. So let's find that.",
Array is set to the exact same one that the method returns.,
Yeah.,
Wait.,
Why not?,
"Oh, I didn't notice that it was already labeled.",
"Well, that's easy.",
So this array is set to a new array. Something about a different array ...,
The bottom one.,
"Yeah, new.",
"Alright, I set 200 [inaudible 03:30:07] and then number three, different array, right? No. It's not right.",
No. I think-,
Zeros? No.,
Oh yeah. You're right. Well-,
I think it's different array than the one in the main method. Wait.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
Eight.,
"It could be this one, after the line is compiled, the array has the values eight, four, 12.",
Zero.,
Yeah. So-,
Part three is actually saying that one number is gonna now be X times Y.,
So-,
I'm so lost. Are there more options here? Because this doesn't seem like enough-,
That's true. So let's just mark that for four.,
Yep.,
Part five is-,
Calling ... But what if we put-,
"Okay. Different array. No. Eight, four, 12, zero?",
"Yeah. Okay, and then three is-",
Which one's three?,
I don't know.,
"Wait, I have different array than the one in the main method, initialized to size four for part two. I'm just not sure about three.",
"Well, we might as well just try.",
Oh yeah.,
For which part?,
I don't think I did actually.,
"Okay, let's not use that one.",
On three? Array is set to a new array.,
"Oh, you don't have that option. Wait, it's the top one.",
Alright.,
"Yeah, that's what is confusing about that part. I'm not sure.",
"It must be though, because none of the options kind of refer to just that one.",
This is difficult. Okay. There we go. Sorry.,
"When a method returns an array, the blank of the array is returned.",
The reference.,
Yeah.,
Good.,
Yeah.,
I won't. [inaudible 03:37:33]. Okay.,
Now-,
Should we do B or C?,
Okay.,
"Okay, that's what I got.",
I don't know. We'll find out when-,
"Oh, it was a zero.",
It probably divided by numbers that couldn't divide.,
"No, it's not multiply. Oh, it is.",
"No, six times two.",
"Yeah, because it's not the remainder thing. It's an actual division, so it would just be-",
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that seems right. Mm-hmm (affirmative). No, it's six divided by two.",
"Yeah, but it's the reverse. It's two divided by six, and so it doesn't work, because it's an integer. It's not a-",
"So these are integers, right?",
"So it can't be a decimal. So if you had two, and you divided it by six, you would have zero point something, but you can't have a decimal, so you just have zero, right?",
Is it?,
"Oh, then I don't know. We better move on though.",
Do you want to do B? Or should we skip to C?,
Okay.,
"Yeah, maybe.",
Uh oh. Completed for homework. Whatever.,
Oh gosh.,
For an argument of an array type [crosstalk 03:40:48] is.,
"No, I don't know. 258. My book page numbers are different than the ones they mention.",
One less?,
"Yeah, I'll go back.",
This is definitely wrong page for me.,
My book is very different.,
Not for me it isn't.,
Yeah.,
7.4.,
Okay.,
"No. No, this isn't right.",
"Well, I've read the whole thing, but I don't remember it. I've read the whole thing twice. Here we go. I found it.",
Yeah. The value of the argument is a references. That's what I said.,
Reference.,
Method is the same as the array being passed. Okay.,
Attempt.,
Yeah.,
Yeah. Okay.,
Where?,
Yeah.,
"It's 10, but then when it gets in there, it's changed to one. So it prints as one.",
I don't know.,
Yeah.,
"I think after the method, the things that change are the ones with the brackets and the index number, and the things that don't change are-",
"Yeah, this one does.",
That one's good. Oh my gosh.,
Which one?,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
"So this one's true. So look, array does change. The things that aren't arrays don't.",
No. It's good.,
No.,
Yes.,
It's okay.,
[inaudible 03:49:17] comes to mind. What?,
Okay.,
Yeah.,
Different variables.,
I just thought about it?,
"Yeah, that's what I said too.",
You're doing great.,
You're doing great.,
"No, you're guessing right.",
Yeah. Okay.,
I'm just confused by this. It's to confusing.,
What?,
Yeah. The difference is that you're just changing the name of the array. You're not actually switching which one the first.,
"Alright. I'm just gonna submit it, because I'm not really sure.",
Whatever. We'll figure it out later. Now we need to do C.,
Hm?,
"Yeah, I'm not sure. I submitted it and I didn't look at my wrong answer, so-",
Okay.,
So first let's just make the array.,
18. My computer is slow.,
Okay. Here we go. Alright.,
"Yeah. Okay. We need the scanner. Uh oh. What'd I do? Hold on. I misspelled this. Okay. So now let's make the array. So we need to make it a string type, and it's gonna be called-",
Name search.,
"Yeah, name search.",
10. The length is 10.,
Okay. Is that what you have?,
Okay. Then we need to do array. We have to create this array by taking in their input.,
Oh. Because that's the method.,
"Oh, so what do you want to call it?",
Okay. Okay. So we're gonna have to make a loop to get the user input.,
"No, we gotta do that now.",
"[inaudible 03:57:40]. It says this array will get 10 names from the user. So we've gotta get the names now, so that there's something in the array. So enter 10 names.",
Yeah. Alright. Now we're definitely gonna need a loop.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
Search dot length?,
"I's gonna have to go up, and then open braces.",
"Yeah, like everything [crosstalk 03:58:52] loop has to be enclosed.",
Yeah. That looks good. So now I guess-,
"Wait. Names. Oh yeah. Okay. Wait, no it's gonna be the name. Let's change search to names, because it's really a list of names. Okay. Names equals input dot next line? How do we do this? I don't remember how to do that. Yeah. Okay. Initializing input values. Oh, right. Don't forget to put I in the braces, in the brackets. [crosstalk 04:00:08] the other one. Yes. I have it here. I think we need to change search dot length, to names dot length.",
Okay. Looks good.,
"You don't need an I in the next line then. So now, the array has stuff in it, so what did we want to do next? Call the method name search? Oh no, we need to ask them for a name to search for.",
Yeah.,
I called it names. Is that too similar?,
I called it name without the S.,
Okay. And now ... Goodness.,
Let's come back to this part and make the method down here.,
"Yeah, let's use string. This one-",
"Called name search. Yeah. Okay. So in here we put like what we're taking in, which is a string, right?",
String.,
"Names. Comma, string name. Isn't that confusing?",
"Okay, but for the first part before the comma, you're calling the string array, so you need to put the sort of like square brackets with nothing in them.",
Yeah.,
Okay.,
And then we could just do linear search. How about that?,
Okay. So we'll do-,
We need to search for that string. So let me find-,
Search.,
"Not on mine. Oh, you're right. Okay. Alright. So we make a loop, and we check if the key equals the array.",
,
Four.,
Great.,
Okay. Let's re-watch this video to make sure we know it. See if there's any captions. Nope.,
"Well, you can see this one if you want.",
I think this is basically what we just went through.,
Isn't that what we were doing? Right there?,
Looks like it to me.,
It's the same. It's what she did.,
That's what she was doing.,
The only difference I see is that it's going down one over here.,
"You got it? Well, so that's basically what she did right up there, right?",
"So, why are we call it bubble sort versus just normal sort? Like selection sort. Oh! Because she was comparing it to a key, wasn't she?",
To try and figure out if-,
"And this doesn't have a key. It just doesn't. So, that makes sense.",
"All right. Let's see if we understand the questions. All right. Let's code ... Oh, this code calls the swap method.",
"Because it says, ""Swap,"" and it has parentheses and numbers in between.",
"Oh, I haven't checked the-",
"I haven't read the question yet. Hang on. Yeah, it looks like selection sort, doesn't it?",
Sorry. I guess the problem I'm having is that-,
"In my textbook, I didn't have the last page, so I know about selection sort, but I don't know about bubble sort.",
"Somewhere in here. Copying erase, no. Way too far.",
Yeah.,
"Oh, there it is.",
"So, what is it saying? Does it look ... No, yeah. You're right. It's bubble.",
Yeah.,
Oh.,
That's all right. We can do that.,
"Okay, the three and the five are going to stay the same, right?",
"Because, so, the first row here is showing what it was. And then the second row shows that they found out that the three was less than the five, so they swapped it.",
"Yeah. So, those are going to stay the same.",
And then check whether five and two are equal or less than ...,
"Yeah. So, since five is greater than two, it's going to swap them, right?",
"And then it's going to have to ... No, this isn't right. I got to re-watch the video.",
"Okay, let's go back to the beginning. Oops.",
That's all right. I set this to work slowly. Hang on.,
Normal. We don't have time for that.,
Oops. Okay.,
"I was fine, five. See, there. This is a problem right there. Because now it's still not in order. It's going to have to go through it.",
All the way and then over again.,
Yep.,
"Yeah, you're right. Okay. So, let's go back.",
"Yep. So, now we've got three, two ... Wait. Five and eight? It's not changing.",
Yep.,
Yeah. Or eight.,
"Stays the same. So, then the next row is also the same, right?",
"Three, two, five, eight.",
"No, not yet. Because we haven't gotten to the end. We've got to check whether the five and the eight are bigger than each other, and since the five is less than the eight, it's going to stay in the same spot and not swap.",
"I think you actually check these two, then you check these two, then you check these two, then you go back to the beginning, and you check these two, you check these two, then you go back to the beginning and you check just those.",
We are?,
"Oh, well it's the value that goes down.",
"Well, I don't know.",
This is what I think.,
"Because we're not ... Wait. So, this is one.",
Yeah.,
"We both got the same numbers there, so it looks good.",
"Well, no, so, I think ignore these for a second, and just look at the numbers.",
"You have these numbers, and they're out of order, right? First, you check these two. If three is less, you swap them. You've done that. But next row, you're checking the next two.",
No. Because then you swap those two.,
"And you can see the two is still smaller than the three, but ... Yeah, that's what you've got for that row. So, then the next row you're checking these two and swapping them or not swapping them. So, this row will actually be the same as the previous row.",
That's what I think.,
And next time you start ... Yeah.,
Yep. Which would make that also.,
Do you think that's right?,
It looks like what?,
Well.,
Okay.,
"All right. So, this one ...",
The textbook.,
Yeah. It does. Swap List I wish List Current Min Index. It just doesn't look like a swap.,
"Okay. It could be merge or heap. I don't know enough. We've already done bubble, though.",
Do you have the textbook for merge and heap? Because I've never seen that before.,
"It says before answering this question with your partner, discuss with the whole group. How do we discuss it with the whole group?",
"No, we just ... Oh well. All right.",
I guess. Okay. Current min ... Let's see what it looks like it's doing.,
What'd you do? Did you finish sixteen already?,
All right. Let's walk through it. This thing basically puts the smallest index.,
I think it's a combination of things.,
Right.,
Oh.,
Okay.,
My computer's freezing.,
"No, it's just frozen for some reason. I can't scroll. There we go. All right. So, selection sort is our answer.",
"We never even heard about the other two, so that can't be right. Okay. Let's recall our mystery method using the following. Okay. This one goes through everything. Oh man.",
Okay.,
"I don't know. It looks like the same as bubble sort to me. Is this a trick? Like, is this two things that do the exact same thing?",
Okay. All I can think to do is like ...,
You want?,
"No, not really.",
"Oh, I know. The difference is selection sort sends it to the end. It doesn't swap the two, it sends the lower number.",
"No, that's not right.",
Yeah.,
"Okay. So, what do you think?",
"And then seven, eight, nine, six is what I've got.",
And then the next one is the same.,
Five was done. [crosstalk 00:18:32] How did the five jump to over there? I don't understand that.,
Yeah.,
That seems like it's two steps in between the first row and the second row.,
"Yeah. I don't know why it would be like that. Well, it's like they took the first number, and they placed it where it falls in order. So, maybe in the next one, they took the first number, two, and they didn't move it because it's still where it should be. And then the next one, I guess they would take the number two and not move it.",
"Three. Wait, they took the number three, they didn't move it. The next time, they took the number five and didn't move it. This time, the eight would move. So, this looks good. And then the next time, they're checking the seven, which here hasn't moved, and then eight, and then-",
"Yeah, so I think it's going to be the same answer every time until the last one, where it flips.",
"So, I don't think they check the six until the fifth time that they're going through it.",
"Yeah, and the next one is also that one because they're checking a nine at that point, and the nine isn't necessarily in the wrong spot.",
"And then the next time they're checking the six, and they put it where it goes.",
What do you think?,
"I mean, that could be bubble sort, but I think it's selection sort.",
"Okay, should we try?",
I think so. I have no idea.,
"We can? It doesn't say, ""retake.""",
Oh. Is it going to show us what we got wrong? Let's study our mistakes first.,
"All of them, or?",
Wait.,
What do you mean?,
I got this one wrong.,
"It looks like it's not supposed to be compile error, but it isn't in order. So, maybe it would just give you a negative one. Because that was for the binary search.",
This one.,
"It's a binary search, and the numbers are not in order, so I thought it was compile error, but maybe it would just return negative one?",
Yeah. I think so.,
"Well, it says one out of one points.",
So that's good.,
"So, we only got one wrong.",
Maybe it was the first one. Maybe there's supposed to be three instead of four?,
Okay.,
You were right here. We should have thought about it more.,
"I said, ""Simplest answer's the truth,"" but it wasn't.",
I know. Sorry.,
"That's because I haven't studied it. This one's 100 percent right, though. So, we-",
"We've really got that down. So, that's good.",
"We did pretty well. We need to ask for help with this section, though.",
Yeah.,
"So, should we try it again?",
"Yeah. All right. Search [inaudible 00:25:26] and then you search binary search. And then you search one, negative one, three? Binary search. It checks the middle.",
"And then the middle is low, so it checks higher, so it never finds it. This would be negative one. Eight is negative one. Nine is the third option. Ten is ... Pretty much everything is the same. Search. If we try it again, and we get a worse score, is that what counts?",
Or does your highest score count?,
"Okay, then let's try it again. Can't hurt.",
Take again.,
We can't. It would be cheating.,
I wonder why.,
Searching.,
First is ...,
Yeah.,
"The first block of code is the linear search, right?",
Yep. And then ...,
It returns one?,
And it returns negative one.,
With ...,
"What is this? It's the same question again, isn't it? What would we return to our found units? All right, we're searching for six. One, two, three.",
Yeah. Examine the above method. It's binary search. And this one has one.,
"Wait a minute. No, it's negative one.",
"This is the one where we put ""compile error"" before. It's negative one, and then the third option for question nine.",
And then this one I think we need to start with three instead of four.,
And it's going to give us 33. I think it's smaller.,
New variable equals two. No. Equals one?,
"Now equals ... Wait, what? A new high variable equals two. And mid is one. Maybe that's what we got wrong.",
"Mid equals six. With, I think, yeah. And then equals the key, and then there's no step eight. Wait, we made two changes in here. This isn't good. I think the first one is still equal to-",
Four. No.,
"Yeah. It's three. So, our new high variable is, yeah. All right. More efficient is binary search. Smallest?",
And first. This is multiple and-,
Neighboring. And then we said this was bubble sort? Was that right?,
All right. Let's see if we can re-do this. Five ...,
"Wait. No, three, two, five.",
"Eight. Three, two, five, eight. Three, two-",
I disagree.,
I disagree.,
Yeah.,
"Yeah, and then the next one is also three, two, five eight.",
"And then three, two, five, eight again.",
Yeah.,
"Three, two, five, eight.",
"The last one's two, three, five, eight.",
Okay.,
All right. Which one was this one? Selection sort?,
Great. And this is where we got it wrong?,
"So, I'm going to listen to you better. What do you think?",
"It's not ... Oh, is it this one? [crosstalk 00:32:38] Right here? Yeah. Right there. So.",
Okay.,
All right.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
Yeah.,
Oh.,
The middles?,
"Okay. Two, three, five, eight. Wait. The problem is that your example ...",
Let me check the last one. The outside ones.,
What are the outside ones?,
Four.,
First we need the length right?,
By the user?,
"Oh, okay. ",
The scanner.,
No?,
Yeah and then we got to make their array right? We can use these as the index.,
"No keep telling me if I'm not doing something right, cause I might make a big mistake.",
"Okay, does that make sense? We want it from?",
Where does the plus one go?,
"I'll just make it eight, maybe.",
"Okay wait so if this was a seven and there wasn't the plus two, it'd be from zero to seven, but not including seven right?",
So we want it to go from two to seven and include it.,
So plus three.,
Okay.,
"Does this need to be eight gram now? Cause now our range is only four, wait. We want a number between two and nine. ",
"Seven, cause that's what we want.",
But plus two only gets us up two. Oh.,
Maybe we do need plus two. Max is.,
I think this is right. Lets try the next step.,
"Okay oh you already did that. So we need to make a array, but they said we needed to call it something. We need to call it May-Array.",
Is this what you got?,
"Good, okay.",
That's what I'm doing too. ,
Okay.,
"I think it's in the spelling of, wait no. New nit.",
Okay.,
"That'll do it, I wonder why it's still not working. Oh it is.",
Okay now we need to fill it with random numbers.,
What do you mean?,
Yeah and we need the nested lobs. ,
No.,
Yeah.,
What ever you would like. ,
"No, no that's not what I mean.",
I kinda like how it's done in the textbook with the rows and columns just because otherwise we're not going to remember what each thing is doing.,
Yeah.,
Oh does it?,
"No, so like here where they say matrix, we want to say main array. But the second one, we don't have to use length one or length to anymore cause we set it to equal.",
The length right?[inaudible 00:07:17] okay.,
Good.,
"So just the length of the whole array. I guess we could just do it that way if you want to. Instead of doing all of this we could just do length one and length two, is that what you want? ",
"I think it is because that's what we set it to. So I think that's good logic. Yeah, let's do it that way.",
Yes you do.,
"Okay, it's got to fill with random numbers between one and nine.",
Okay.,
"You know what, I'm changing my mind on the random numbers at the top. I think instead of seven, we need eight. Cause we want it to be inclusive of the last number right?",
Yeah I think we should [crosstalk 00:09:02],
I don't think it's three.,
What's that?,
Yeah. So that's where we'd have a plus one but we might as well just write eight.,
"Yeah, I can keep my hand up while you finish.",
"Well for us we want to do int. Math dot random times nine, and then plus one so it doesn't start from zero cause we need a number from one to nine. Try and get that to come around. You know, length is a hard word to spell, I think it might be the t and the h need to be swapped up there.",
Yeah. There we go.,
It is your array. ,
It is your array. Okay now we need to print the array. So that should be just.,
"Oh we just wanted to get confirmation that our logic is good for the math, random. So this is, we need a number from two to nine including eight right?",
"So it's gonna start from zero if we don't put the plus two, right? And then so what you need to do is do max minus mean, which is seven.",
Yeah.,
Eight.,
Eight. This is good.,
Ten is too high.,
Okay thank you.,
"Minus min plus one plus whatever, the min.",
All right so this should be good. So let's try and.,
Yeah it's nice.,
"Yeah. Now we know. I think we're gonna need these nested loops again, in order to [crosstalk 00:12:10] ",
Yeah.,
Number B.,
Wait no no. We haven't done B yet. We're gonna do B.,
"Yeah, we're gonna need two loops to do that though. Why don't we just use the same text from up here again?",
"Yeah, sounds good. ",
Yeah so we're gonna want to print in between each of those end brackets. So one up.,
"Yeah, that looks good.",
"No I take it back, I thought you had already done that. So we just don't need this last row of writing and we're gonna have to print there. ",
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
"It's not actually, it's printing the value at the intersection of these two indexes. ",
No it's only printing what's there.,
"Yeah it looks great. And then after the last bracket ends, do the closed one.",
Oh you're missing one.,
I think you need another.,
"Maybe two more. Yeah that's better. All right so I'm gonna go right in between these next two end brackets, put this on.",
Oh it is printing both.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
Lets run it and see what happens.,
This isn't good. We need to format it differently. ,
We need to print both and I think we're not doing that.,
We to. ,
Hey how'd you do that?,
Okay. Let me try. That's nice.,
This isn't right though. Cause the numbers in here can only be between one and nine. Oh they are. Okay.,
"That's good. So whatever these random numbers were, I think they ended up being six that time but if we print it again it'll be a different size. Okay.",
Yeah that ones[inaudible 00:16:25],
That's so satisfying. Okay.,
Yes. Thank you. Okay so we're on C now. Calculate the average of numbers in each column.,
Look.,
Cause we're gonna calculate the average later so it should be double.,
"All right, then let's start with nit. ",
"It's okay. All right, so we need to add them together first.",
What do you mean?,
Wait but the first number has to be the total. So we're gonna have to go through it.,
I'm a hand you a loop.,
Oh like a counter.,
Or the sum.,
end sum.,
Equals zero.,
Well we don't have the average yet.,
"Yeah but we can do that late. Oh okay we'll do both, how's that?",
"No, you're thinking in order, and I'm thinking out of order so this is good.",
Yeah.,
Yes.,
So it said to calculate the average of the column. So the column is everything down that way.,
Basically doing this.,
Except that the total or the sum.,
"Yeah, so.",
I think we're gonna have to adapt it.,
I think this is what we need.,
"Cause it's always gonna be zero, right? Cause that's the first one, but the I is gonna go up as opposed",
Oh sum plus equals.,
Yeah that looks good.,
Yeah.,
All right great.,
Yeah. ,
So we've already got average so we can say average equals sum.,
Yeah you're right. We don't even need that.,
Divide by? Well I'm doing length too. ,
Print.,
Yeah.,
"Yeah, but you should probably describe it so we know what we're printing. ",
Oh no.,
"So we were supposed to calculate the average of the numbers in each column. So we do need double loops. We need the average of every number so, or do they want it for?",
"Wait, from the average of all columns or the average of all numbers?",
I guess what I misread was I thought it said calculate the average of the numbers in the first column but they mean in every column. So we need to make it check every variable. ,
"I think it's just one, like all together. Like the average of every column. Cause then it says print average of all columns. The average does not have to include digits after decimal point. ",
Yeah.,
So let's just add this part in.,
"This middle line. Cause that's what I skipped. I thought we didn't need it but we do. So I'm changing I to row, okay?",
Yeah.,
Yeah. Row all right.,
Okay.,
I know.,
Right.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
"Wait, I think the outer loop should be length one and the inner loop should be length two.",
So here's what I've changed.,
"Yeah, length one and where it says that matrix. We're not using that. ",
Yeah.,
The columns and rows.,
Okay. ,
Oh know.,
"Yeah, sounds like it. Wait a minute.",
"Uh oh, it's not divided by length two anymore. It's divided by length two times length one. Right? To get every number?",
I'm gonna have to do that. Okay.,
What you got? I have [inaudible 00:26:36] yeah.,
And I might put parenthesis around those two so that it does that before the division. ,
"Great, let's test it.",
Well that makes sense. ,
What'd you get,
That's great.,
"No I'm not.so what else do we need to do? Find a maximum, oh gosh. Find the maximum average and print it.",
We did that.,
"We did that. But what do they mean by method? It has to be in a method? Oh cause it's length dot something, that's fine. ",
"All right, wait it needs to print in a decimal though so in the end it does need to be a double.",
Can be 3.0.,
Does not have to include.,
Okay so lets not worry about it. The maximum average value is okay. So we need to find.,
"wait a minute, what do they mean by maximum average? So they did want a bunch of different averages. Shoot so we were right before we just needed to do it for all our columns.",
Yeah.,
I think what they're doing is ,
"Yeah but like if you look at column one, two plus four plus five divided by three is three. And six plus six plus two.",
So we need to actually do those in separate loops. So what we had before was actually good.,
Yeah so we need to make a bunch of different averages of the columns so.,
No no I think they just said length method. I don't think it's.,
"So think about this, how do we get that?",
"So let's just put a zero where it says row, and see if that doeS It.",
Why not?,
"Okay. But it's always gonna start at zero, right?",
"No, but this is the index, number the index number are gonna go one, two , three, every single time. ",
How do you know when to stop?,
"Because instead of four loops, it stopS after that blank, right?",
"Yeah yeah, I agree. ",
"Yeah I think, we don't need the inner loop again. Sorry about that. And then, instead of column?",
"These row, I for column and row column column [inaudible 00:31:50] ",
"Yeah, let's do that.",
Yeah.Mine too?,
"All right so the column is the first, now your angel. This needs to be column and it's going up right ",
"Yeah, so that's not good. But if we did column here, then it would be zero the first time, Which is good, right? And then it would be two, three, four, till the end of the, was how many columns there are, but this is what we need to figure out because first we want it to be I, then the next time we want it to be I plus one. We want this to go up slowly, right?",
"Go real slowly, not as fast as thing goes up, so it's like we need another loop outside of this.",
The same as what we had?,
But how were they separated out?,
"But we only got one number, and we want an average for every single column. Well okay, let's do it this way. ",
"If we did it like this we're getting the average for just the one first column, right?",
"You need this to go up, and we need to get, I mean we could do it again, right?",
Maybe.,
"And then, what we change is right here, this zero, that's a good idea let's do that. So were just gonna take this whole thing, put it lower down.",
"I did, I don't know if we're gonna need it or not.",
Yeah.,
Right. I'm gonna put a space in here so we can see it properly. Okay you know what I think we need to put average back outside of it.,
"Okay. Did you bring sum? No you didn't. Okay, I'll take these back up.",
I remember length more.,
Yeah.,
"Okay. We have to change the length to main array, dot length 'cause I didn't bring length one into unless you want to. ",
Dot length now why are you calling this average? I thought what this does.,
"OkaY, that's fine I put this and then maybe we should put index or something so that we can if we put index there and we put index instead of zero. Great, down here. And then.",
"No, lower. What do you have length in the brackets below? You don't want that, you want index.",
But then we need to declare it outside of this loop too. I mean outside of the method.,
No I won't. Okay so now lets figure out what we're doing down here. We've done this.and now after this we want it to go up right?,
Yeah.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
"Called it yeah. So I know we need to make the index go up but I think we need to do that up here, like outside. ",
" So I'm gonna take that up and we're gonna, so up here we've got. Actually let's put this down in here.",
Oh gosh. Okay so.,
We need a limp here. We could probably put this is the method don't you think?,
We'll make that what is the result how's that?,
We'll just say we can't use length two.,
This isn't good. We can't use length two.,
And this isn't good either. I think we should bring in length two as well. And just change main array dot length to length two.,
It's just easier.,
"I think line one refers to how far across to row, but we want to get how far down the.",
I might have it reversed but we'll find out. ,
Return average. What's that?,
"No, one higher.",
Okay so this needs to be in a loop.,
Maybe a wild loop.,
Maybe.,
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
Lets see if this works.,
Oh wait we haven't called it. We can't just say average anymore we have to call this method.,
Call them average. And then we have to put all of those things in it.,
Yeah.,
"Two, index. Okay I'm gonna test it see how it goes. Oops.",
"Well I don't know I still had it written, the average ball columns but its really the averages. The first column.",
Okay.,
Oh sorry let me try it again. Oh that's easy. The average.,
"Okay so I've got the lengths reversed. I think I need to, I think we both need to change this to length two here and then in the method bring in length one instead. ",
"Okay lets see. This is bad, I think this should be minus one. Let's try that again.",
This is probably here and it needs to be minus one here too. Let's try that. Oh man I can't calculate that.,
Nine five three five seven seven one. So there's how many numbers?,
"Wait. One two three. Okay. Four, that's not bad.",
"Wait but there are one two three four five six seven columns, and there's one two three four five six so it should have printed another plat.",
Maybe I didn't need this one here. No I need that one there. See it should have printed twice. Why is the average one?,
"This isn't right. Two plus eight is ten, divided by two is five. The average should be five. ",
Well yeah I switched it so it's length one here and it's length.,
that's weird.,
Yeah.,
See this one didn't get an error. Why would it sometimes give an error and sometimes not? Oh it must be something wrong with [crosstalk 00:45:24] random numbers.,
This isn't good.,
"So this thing is cycling through and getting index the first time, this is zero, and this one is also zero. Then the next time it's one and two and three.",
"It does but only each time we call the method, so we're calling it a loop so maybe that's the problem. But we can't call it in a loop.",
I don't know.,
Wait so.,
Yeah I think it might be our random numbers. Maybe these need to be back to seven. Let's try it with seven.,
Row okay.[inaudible 00:46:58] We're using length one for row. And length two for columns so maybe we do need length two. And length two here. ,
"But this one should only ran with length one. And length two. Lets try that. One two three four five, oh I'm counting the wrong way. One two three four five. So this should go one two three four five times. I think we're getting the average of the rows instead of the columns.",
Five. 22 divided five would be like 4 or something.,
"Okay that's not it than. What about, do you want to try the five seven and five?",
Five seven ,
"One, six, eight eight five divided by eight.",
"Yeah, I don't know what this number is than.",
It doesn't match up for the average of this or that. ,
What happens if we don't use this line? And instead we just increment it out.,
"Average is three so this 12, 13, 14, 19 divided by five. That is three. This is three. So that's good.",
Yeah 19 divided by five.,
"So we've got it once, the question is just how do we do it another time? And this loop is not the kind of loop we need. So maybe we should try a four loop.",
Okay can't hurt right.,
"Can't I use index? This might do the same thing as what we were just doing before. You se there's only three columns so it should only oh blank two, sorry. Maybe without the minus one.",
Sorry. One two. What do we count? Like one two three four five six seven eighth.,
One two three four five six.,
I don't have a minus one on here anymore.,
Should I take it off from here?,
"Why's it only showing us two? It's like the whole thing is averaging the rows instead of the columns. So maybe what we need is columns on this side, oh that makes sense. That's probably because I been changing this one back and forth. Cause I can't figure it out.",
"Yeah, then we definitely need a minus one.",
Yeah. ,
This is not right.,
Yeah. Oh well at least that one was doing the right thing there. One of these has to be column two. This ones gotta be column one right cause we're counting how many numbers there are in the column. But if we do that we're gonna need to call it in.,
Wait this is red though. One two three four five. One two three four five. So why are we then getting this?,
One two three four five six seven. One two three four five six seven okay this is good. ,
Should I try it again? It's the random numbers that are no good. I changed these right?,
Sorry. This is very bad.,
Yeah.,
"Sometimes, sometimes not.",
Okay got a loop calling it and a loop in the method so it might be looping too many times.,
They're all at the top.,
"Oh I know, we shouldn't be using the index as the counter. Index should be it's own thing and then we could use I. Its going up so it's making the range get smaller.",
That makes sense.,
Lets see if we can fix it then.,
Okay.,
Thanks.,
I think I figured it out.,
"Cause the way we had it, we were making this go up.",
"And then making that go up, oh I is less than. Oops. That was my problem, I had it turned the opposite way. I was graded on.",
Four. All right. So.,
"It says, this method gets two-dimensional array as input and count the average of all elements. The second one.",
No. Yeah. You're right.,
"Just as a reminder, assignment three is due in two days. April 14th.",
14th.,
"No, it'll be fine.",
"Yeah. What do we call it, like, display maybe?",
"Display array, maybe?",
Okay.,
"Yeah. It's two-dimensional, so it's got two empty spaces.",
No. It's its own thing. So here's what I've got so far.,
"So, if we store their input as something and then we put that into this array instead of zero, it would be whatever we call it.",
"So like, if they say they want there to be seven rows, then whatever we're calling their answer we'll put in here?",
Yeah.,
Okay. ,
Yeah.,
Oh.,
"Yeah, you could.",
I'm going to leave mine.,
Um. Array? That's what I called mine.,
Does it say that?,
Turns two-dimensional rides with the main method to create a method.,
"I think we should just [crosstalk 00:06:40] them write in what numbers they want in it. Like, say enter this many numbers, and we'll store those in here.",
"Yeah, so, right now up until this point, all we've done is created an empty array with zeros at all locations, and so we've asked them how big we want it to be, we haven't put anything in it. So I feel like the only way we can move forward is to ask them to put some of the numbers [crosstalk 00:07:19]. Yeah.",
Here? Yeah.,
"Yeah, I used that, and I was like, I don't think it's going to run without that.",
"There are errors in the book for sure. I mean, remember when she did the exercise from the book and it didn't work.",
"Yeah, that's probably good.",
Yeah.,
What?,
That's the length of [crosstalk 00:10:16],
Yeah.,
Okay.,
No. Right now it's anything you enter.,
"No, you're fine. I don't think-",
I don't think this is good though.,
"So, first we asked them for the lengths of the columns and the rows. Oh. Let me try that one more time to make sure that we're on the right track.",
Where?,
After this loop?,
Oh.,
Just nothing?,
I dunno. 12?,
There.,
My main total was going to be 12.,
There's a problem with this though.,
"We need to get the user input at least for the lengths before the method. Because right now, if this is a method that returns an array, we can't print the array, right?",
"Because we'd have to know how to do these loops, but we can't know how long to set each loop because we don't know this number. So we're going to have to ask them for the lengths outside of the method.",
"Okay. So like, if, instead of all this stuff, I deleted all this and we just said return array? Then, in order to print it, we'd have to say, system got out, but we'd also have to put it in those loops, right?",
"It doesn't work. I tried. I mean, I can give the lengths and enter numbers and everything, but it's not going to print it, right? Because it needs to be in loops.",
A lot. I'll get there.,
"I didn't think of it. See? I entered all the numbers, but I can't print it, so maybe we should ask them these things earlier.",
Passed them into the left. So let's take these first five rows.,
No.,
Just this part.,
Okay.,
That's a good sign. You probably did it right.,
So now we need it up above.,
"So now we're actually going to be passing these numbers in, right?",
It's N1 and it's N2?,
"Sorry, what else?",
Oh yeah. Nice.,
Input that next. That's good.,
You do.,
"Oh, that's right. Did that fix it?",
"Yeah, you're right. That's what we needed.",
"Okay. So now instead of getArray, we need to put that around some loops, right?",
This isn't good.,
"No, it's not.",
Yeah.,
"I mean, we've got the length for the array, but we can't-",
Oh. Could put N1 comma N2. Yeah. So you might only need one loop. Let me test it.,
"No, that didn't work.",
Why don't we do all of the creation up here and then the display down here.,
Okay. Let's do that.,
"It's okay, we can just move it right?",
I have to move a lot.,
"I have to move a lot. We have to take everything except return, right?",
Well because those double loops are putting the numbers into the array.,
"No, so the lengths are already above. This is the numbers inside the array.",
I think we need to.,
To display.,
I think so.,
"I mean, we can't ever display if we do that.",
Just display it and send the answer up?,
Yes.,
"... calculate the average, right?",
Sorry.,
"Okay, but how did they get the lens?",
Okay.,
So this is... Oh. ,
"Got it. So, if M equals, and here we just say, M, I and oops. J. And then make another loop here that's for J? Does that sound good?",
And then this is a print line.,
"Right. So getArray is this. And we no longer need that, right? And then as long as what we return.",
I'm using what you just showed me.,
"Yeah, yeah.",
Yeah.,
Right.,
Right.,
"That looks good. So, the only real problem left here is there's no problem. Let me try it.",
No problem.,
"Trying to save me from myself. Oops, I forgot to put the other print line down. That would have to be here, right?",
Okay. Two rows.,
"Three columns. So, if we're doing this-",
"In theory. Oh yeah, this is all good. Let's do this.",
"Yeah, I mean, you've got to get the lengths in the main because otherwise you won't know how to use them up here to print it. Right?",
"It's a good thing you said that about the extra line, the extra print line, because I was just going to be stuck because I didn't know.",
That's funny.,
Oh.,
The next thing we're going to do is the average.,
We've got to do the average method soon.,
Yeah. It should be fine. I'm going to-,
You've got to finish the fore loop I think.,
Yeah.,
You're good.,
"Wait, are you in the method there?",
"I think you're on auto pilot a little bit, because instead of doing that, we want to do the method. But it printed.",
"So, do you have-",
Did you declare it up here? Like set it to the value of M?,
Okay.,
"Yeah, put that one higher up and set it to M so that we can just call M.",
Yeah. And it's two-dimensional.,
Yeah.,
"So now, you can use M and I [crosstalk 00:27:41]",
"Yeah, yeah.",
M then I and J and I put a space in between them.,
Yeah.,
Because you've got-,
Wait. ,
"It looks fine. No, no. You need that.",
Go back down.,
"You haven't declared array, so do something like, insArray [crosstalk 00:29:04] equals. Yeah. This line.",
"Well, the way I figure it, we're creating one in the method and then we're just assigning it a new name outside of the method, like in the main method.",
Yeah.,
"No, you're good. With the beginning of that row, that line, up higher, higher, higher, right there. It needs to say array. That'll fix it.",
It's okay. So now let's get the average.,
Okay. So let's make a new method.,
"No, we can just call the other method.",
Yeah. That didn't work.,
It doesn't seem like that would work. So maybe we need to call it... wait.,
"Yeah, so can we put that right in here?",
"Okay. No, it doesn't look like we can.",
"Yeah, that could be the problem. Let's just do the stuff in the middle.",
"Yeah, let's do two four loops, and then the sum again.",
Okay. ,
I'll worry about that part later.,
I'm putting the loops in.,
No.,
This is so wrong.,
I'm holding in. Hang on.,
Okay. So let's keep going.,
I'm not sure yet. I figured we'd go back and get it later.,
I don't know if I'm doing it right.,
Okay. I'll slow down.,
"No, you're right, maybe we just need the array.",
But I think it's called M. It is working with M.,
"If you put M there instead of array, it works.",
"M. I. J. No, it doesn't work. I take it back.",
We're getting the sum first.,
And then we're going to use that to get the average.,
"I did, yeah. All right, sum divided by... oops.",
"First we're just going to calculate the average in there, and then turn the average.",
I set the sum up here equal to zero. But here you don't need it because you're saying the data-type right there. Or at least it's not giving an error.,
"Okay. Click okay. Well, where are we?",
Well I figured the length of the entire-,
That cough is going to be really loud on this thing.,
Should we test these?,
"No, there's no problem. We just need to make sure the main method [crosstalk 00:36:06]. Yeah. So we'll just put that in there.",
"The average, or average?",
Okay. N1 comma N2.,
Yeah.,
I brought down both Ns.,
"Both Ns. Oh, and the M.",
That's better. All right. I'm testing it. Ah!,
No. ,
"No, it didn't work. Oh wait. No, it did work.",
I take it back. It did work. I just didn't tell it that this last thing is the average.,
Yeah. ,
"Because that's what the prompt said, right?",
"Oh, sorry.",
Let me see.,
"We need to make it print, yeah.",
Nice. That'll work.,
Where?,
Scroll down.,
"Yeah, it looks good.",
Sum divided by-,
That's what I've got.,
"Okay. Scroll down a little. There's an error on the, oh no. Keep going.",
Maybe there's too many brackets somewhere. No. That looks fine. Scroll up again. It could be where you're doing things up here.,
"Okay. What's this line doing, right there? intArray?",
Well how come you've got that there? I've got that way down in the method. intArray should be in getArray.,
Yeah. And then make sure it's in the getArray method. Scroll down to look.,
Yeah. That looks good. There's an I in there now. Okay.,
I wonder why it didn't give you more of an error.,
"Okay, exception main.",
"Wait, let me see where I've got that.",
"Yeah. Wait, can you scroll back up for a second? It all looks good to me. All right, let's start from the bottom. We've got literally the same thing here and mine's working. Yours is not.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,
"Oh, you've got them both set to N2. Change that first one to N1.",
All right.,
Yay!,
Now let's do part 2.,
Yeah. We can put comments in later.,
I thought he said don't put pseudo-comments.,
Okay. Write a program that searches for a character in two-dimensional array. For this you need to define a method that creates a two-dimensional array with user-defined size and close the array with random characters.,
"And also instead of filling it with user input, we're filling it with random characters.",
And it's characters. It's not numbers. So we've got to do it with characters.,
I still think we should take pretty much all of this and adapt it. ,
Start a new file.,
You don't want to lose it.,
Oh no.,
Okay. And make sure the title is the same as what you saved it as.,
I did. We're going to have to go through it and change the type of the array to character. Right?,
Okay.,
Oh no. I think we should start from scratch.,
"Because it's with characters, so...",
I think we do.,
Let's just try and work through it step by step.,
Yeah.,
Can you actually have a character array or do we need to make it as an integer array and then convert it to random characters?,
So should we declare it as a character array?,
All right.,
Okay.,
So.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
I'm calling it array.,
All right. So we need to use method again.,
I wonder-,
Yeah.,
So-,
I moved this last line into the method because it seems like it should go there.,
"And then, all we have to put into the array is N1 and N2. Like in the method into N1 and into N2.",
"All right. So in, and then I just set it here. Oh wait. Let's use M again, how's that?",
"How are we going to generate random characters? So, I wish I had that chapter.",
Yeah. I don't even know how to start.,
"Wait, no, no. That might actually be in the book.",
We'll find it.,
Yeah. ,
"No, I think it's in this most recent one, actually.",
Or maybe seven.,
"No, you're right. It might not be in these chapters.",
Like what?,
You mean char?,
Oh.,
Okay.,
That's good. You need another loop though. You need two nested loops since it's a-,
"So, we're working with two-dimensional arrays.",
"Yeah, that's good.",
Won't they show you the alphabet-,
"Oh, it printed numbers though, so you can convert that from unicode.",
"Yeah. I mean, I think the answers are right, they just need to be converted back.",
Oh.,
Hey!,
But how do we make it random?,
"Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. So, for us, it's nice. For us, we do two loops to put these random things into it.",
Right? Let's do it together.,
"Yeah. I might just do ""it."" ",
"Wait a minute. No. It's still going to be the same loops, and then we'll do that later. ",
Why'd you do one? I'm doing zero.,
"No, that can't be it, because that's not true.",
"All right, so.",
So we're going to do array with the I and J equals-,
... a random thing. Right?,
"Now, how do you do that again? Math dot random?",
Wait. Or char?,
You'd have to do int first?,
All right. ,
Z minus A for the range.,
"Plus the minimum, which is A. Right? Am I right? Wait. So this is the range. Max minus min plus one. Right?",
You think we should do int first? ,
"No, it's working.",
Yeah. I'm doing a bunch of parentheses.,
Yeah.,
Yeah. And then outside of those-,
Plus A. Should it be minus A?,
Yep. And then if you put a semicolon at the end and open parentheses before math.,
All right. ,
I think so. We just need to make sure to remember to call it.,
"No, because we haven't called it.",
"No, I've gotten the return but I haven't made it print. So we needed two four loops again.",
Yeah. I think so. Wait. Is that what we're supposed to do?,
I don't know. We don't need to. We can just ask them for a character and if it's there. So we need to make another method that searches for the character.,
"Okay. But we can't let them see it, because then they'll always win the game.",
Yeah.,
That's where it is but-,
... we're not printing it.,
Yeah.,
"Now it's called M. Right? So M, I, gosh I hope this works. ",
Wait.,
Okay. We're getting close.,
We're getting close. Did yours work?,
Yeah. I'm going to test it.,
Oh!,
"It worked, but we got the wrong characters.",
"It's probably that, yeah.",
"Oh, I made it worse. I changed it to A instead of plus 1. ",
These aren't the lowercase characters. I think we need to change our range.,
"Or maybe we need more parentheses. I mean, it's working, it's just-",
... got some issues.,
I did it.,
It just needed more parentheses around the Z and the A.,
Why'd you erase the whole thing?,
"I think it would be good to change the narrative, because I think you're very smart.",
Yeah. Let's not do that anymore. No more.,
1?,
"No, outside of that, I have a plus A just to be safe.",
Yeah. ,
"Okay. Something's different. Oh no, it's good. Sorry.",
"That looks good. All right. So, now, let's make one more method and then we'll be done.",
Wait. Let me try again.,
"Okay, that's not good.",
Plus 1.,
Okay.,
"Wait. I got rid of the one and I still don't get Z or A. It could have just been chance. Let me try again. Oh, I got A. Yeah, it's all good. But I didn't get Z.",
One you can still get As.,
So maybe what we needed was minus one.,
Okay. Wait. Don't get rid of this A on the outside.,
"Okay, minus one doesn't work.",
Yeah. It's better like this. ,
[crosstalk 01:04:32],
"So, what we really need is for the Z to be plus one.",
Oh yeah. That's it.,
[crosstalk 01:04:59] Nice. Did we get any Zs?,
"I think I figured it out. We need it to be Z plus one minus A, don't we?",
Okay. Let's try that. Nope. That's not it.,
What about Z plus A?,
What's half to Z?,
Well we have the plus one [crosstalk 01:05:52] either.,
Let's try it again.,
Try it one more time.,
There's a Z.,
We might need two plus ones.,
"Yeah, let's try that. Let's see what happens.",
"Oh, it's worse. It's better to have it.",
What did you do?,
Four.,
"Yeah, recited mine.",
Okay.,
Hang on. All right.,
I'm just following what she did before.,
She said five and nine?,
"No, it doesn't matter.",
Yeah.,
Um...,
So where are you at?,
"Okay, so the way-",
"Yeah, that's what I don't know. But I know that it's gonna have to be in the loop. Like in the first loop.",
"Well, everything happens within this big loop, and then there's smaller loops inside it for sure. Like, this set of two loops is gonna print it, right?",
I think we should do it like this.,
"Okay, let's go back. So, up here, let's start the loop and then do the like, press enter command, and maybe it'll just work on its own. Who knows?",
"Hey. It worked, but it did all of it too fast. I never pressed enter.",
Yeah.,
Exclusive. Yeah that looks good.,
"Okay, so then we need to get the user input, but I think there's a trick to this. Like, we need to say-",
"No, but it printed it all without me pressing enter.",
"It did it all right but like, I never pressed anything. So it should only be like if...",
I don't know.,
Really?,
Okay.,
"Oh, I got it.",
"I just put input.nextline, just that's it.",
Yeah. So this works.,
"Oh, um, it's the counter of the first loop. For you, it's I. And then the second number is the random number. So for you, it's index.",
So like...,
"Right, so mine looks like this.",
"Yeah, think so. She made this too easy for us, huh?",
"She made it too easy for us, she told us to rush-",
"Well, yeah. There's no mystery anymore.",
Yeah.,
"Okay, but don't forget, since this is a two-dimensional array now, you're gonna have to do two loops around the print statement.",
"Yeah, you always have to.",
"'cause right, now you're gonna do two index numbers but you don't have anything to...",
"Yeah, so just make two loops.",
Yeah. I used K and Q.,
I don't know. You could try.,
The rows. The rows and then the second moves the columns.,
15,
The second one's gotta be the-,
Yeah. Okay. And then it should be fine to just print it.,
And don't forget we're gonna have to need another print line.,
Yeah. Like you taught me.,
I would press the stop on there and see if there's anything missing. Even in doing the second print line. ,
I think it's one higher. Yeah. I wonder why it wasn't working. Could just be the computer.,
I think it's just the computer.,
Did you want a space in-between the quotation marks?,
"Okay. Maybe that'll work. Oh you have to press enter. Nice. It's good. It's just that you never like, said ""Press Enter"" to the user, so like, up.",
"Yeah, before that line.",
Little tired?,
"Oh, on the part where you're prompting them to say enter, you won't put that in the first loop. So, like, take that part all the way down. The only thing that should be outside of the loop is the declaration. Cause we want them-",
"To ask over and over again. No, yeah.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative),
"Yeah, pretty much. That should do it. Okay. Yay. Wait a minute, how come you only have four rows?",
"Oh, you set it to one. You can set it to zero in the beginning. But then you need to set all the other loops to zero as well.",
You're okay. All right.,
Nice. Does that have nine across? It looks like it.,
"So, it's only gonna put a one in each row.",
Mm-hmm (affirmative),
No. It starts from first and then...,
It could be anywhere on the row hopefully.,
"And then we need to do the checking to see if they've won, which is this part.",
"Yeah, like two before, yeah.",
"First you need a boolean variable, so that you can figure out whether they won or not.",
Yeah.,
Yeah.,
"Um, yeah. The if statement goes inside the second loop. So basically we're just gonna do the same two loops that we did out here, but instead of printing... well instead of having it set to five and nine, we have it set to nine and five. And then... we can swap. Oh.",
This needs to be H and this needs to be B.,
No.,
"But basically, like we just need the same old loops again but we're swapping the lengths.",
'cause that's the equivalent of nine on the top and five on the bottom. And then we'll do the if else.,
"You're using I, J, okay. Yeah, so they swap.",
"Yeah. Matrix for you, it's called array.",
"And you wanna make it set to like, use the counter from the inner loop for the first part and the counter from the outer loop for the second. So instead of zero and zero. The inner loop one. Yeah. Yeah that looks good.",
Yeah. That looks good.,
"The brackets, yeah.",
"Too close. Yeah, and then last thing is make a little if else statement to print whether they won or lost.",
"Is it called array? Scroll up for a second. Int of array? Oh I know. No, I don't know. Oh, if it equals instead of like, making a new assignment, yeah. So then all you need is some sort of if else to show them whether they've won or not.",
Yeah.,
Right.,
"Well key's a boolean, right, so it can be true or false.",
Okay.,
Yeah.,
I'm just gonna put in some comments for a second.,
Is it working?,
"You won, you're a winner.",
But it worked. I wonder how many times you have to try it for you to win.,
"It's addicting, huh?",
I don't know. I think it's working fine though.,
Are there more questions?,
No.,
"That's it. If you really wanted to know, you could make your arrays way smaller, so like... let me test this. 'cause mine's the same as yours, right? I'll make it three and four, how's that?",
And set this to... four. Okay let me try again.,
"Well, I mean it's an improbable program, isn't it? Oh, I was so close that time. Let me try one more time. Oh.",
It's just fun.,
It's just fun.,
"Oh, if you get all the ones in the same column.",
Yeah yeah. That's okay though.,
I guess so. I'm trying to write some comments in to make sure.,
Okay.,
How you doing?,
Okay.,
Okay.,
Okay.,
You wanna do the exit form?,
Pseudo code.,
(laughs),
Is it working?,
There it is.,
"Okay, let's see.",
"Oh no, the grades.",
He's updated the grades. I don't wanna see it.,
Okay. Let's do the exit form instead. Catch the train.,
Why?,
"Oh, click on the title. Uh, just wait a second. It's thinking.",
"Wait, okay. Once there...",
"And then just once up top. Yeah. Um, are you logged in? It looks like it's logged you out. Like, are you logged in in a different email account at all?",
"Yeah, switch users. Switch to the one that does your school account. Yeah.",
"Okay, we're taking this off. ",
I gotta go to the bathroom soon.,
I need to go to the bathroom.,
I'll hold it.,
Are other people confused or what's happening?,
