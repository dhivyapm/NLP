Is it working?
"Yeah, that's pretty confusing."
"You wouldn't have to use the method. You could knock it out, but it's just like you have to use the method."
"Pulling out the book. So let's see, square."
"So pretty much the four methods that we're writing are just going to be for the rectangle, triangle, circle, square. Pretty much we just pull that into the main, right? That's what we're doing, right?"
"Oh, okay. You mean from the [crosstalk 00:20:57]?"
"Oh, okay."
I wonder if our lab tomorrow is going to have us doing this.
"Nice, awesome."
"Yeah, I know."
"So that's your main method, right? You did the whole thing-"
The math part?
"Oh, okay. Are you on the spatial reason [crosstalk 00:34:02]?"
"Oh, you didn't do that?"
"Yeah, I did that. It's pretty easy."
"Yeah, it was really easy actually. I was wondering, is that 10 points if you do all of it?"
I think that's what it said.
"All right, is that what it says?"
If you do all of them?
"I'm telling you, if you do it, you can do it in five minutes."
Yeah.
"Yeah, you should."
"You can make, what, 76 if you do all this extra credit?"
"I don't think there's one time that anybody has finished the assignment in class, you know what I mean?"
I know. And this time we even have the flow chart. We were supposed to do a flow chart for that first one too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's pretty much the same thing, right? You just changed the-"
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Is it?
Which one is it?
"Oh, it's one of those? Oh, okay."
Let's see.
"Yeah, you can. I always like to compare and contrast my codes. Yeah."
"Well, since you said that, I'm just rewriting the if. Then. Yeah, because I always ... Yeah, so then I have to erase all that stuff and just to the math portion, just like what you said. So yeah. Yeah, I-"
Break it. So [inaudible 00:49:07].
"[crosstalk 00:49:34] You stay on campus, or-"
"I said, do you stay on campus?"
Yeah.
8:25
"I'm telling you, hardly anybody finishes this assignment."
"Oh, I didn't even know there was a ... The equals ignore case. I didn't even know that that negs this. I did not know that."
I did not know that man. What?
"Yeah, because I was using it for ... Yeah, I didn't know about that. That's awesome. Is that actually in the book? I must have missed it, you know?"
"Gosh man. Man, this class is like all self-taught."
"Yeah, [inaudible 00:51:35]."
Google and YouTube man. That's me.
That's my snow.
"Oh, we're not [inaudible 00:52:54] [crosstalk 00:52:56]."
34
Okay.
That gets a string that counts the number of hours in [inaudible 00:56:57].
What's that? Let's see.
I don't know how to split. Do you know how to split?
Didn't think about that.
"That's what I've been doing too. I'm just taking screenshots here and writing down the answers. 'Cause it seems like she pulls a lot softballs out of nowhere, so that's what. [crosstalk 01:20:15] [inaudible 01:20:15] She can hear us."
"I forgot, she's gonna know our secret. I forgot. Oh. I'm struggling honestly a lot. Okay. I sot of got the [inaudible 01:22:56]. I have to be able to do it the way you do, because I have to sit and think of it. That takes me a while."
Right. Yeah.
What's your name?
"Oh, is that why he did it? That's hilarious. I mean you do this and I'll be the other one, fourteen [inaudible 01:30:24]"
"You do the spatial reasoning stuff and then you do this, 14 point sections."
That's a lot of points.
That's why I decided to do this.
Yeah. I made a 60 on it.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do about that.
"Oh. Well, I don't know why they make such a big emphasis on [crosstalk 01:50:47] for it."
"Because they only use it to chat, for passwords and stuff."
That's what they mainly use it for.
"[inaudible 01:51:06] the chat, the characters and stuff."
I guess it must be pretty important.
Can I talk [inaudible 01:52:58] first half too.
"Oh, I don't know."
[crosstalk 01:55:26] ...
"I mean, [inaudible 01:55:29] ..."
"Okay, I think I got it."
Damn man. You're the man.
"I'm sorry, I ... I didn't say that. (laughter)"
"Yeah, yeah."
This battle has been brutal.
"The way it's looking, it's not looking good. For me anyway."
"Because I mean, it takes a while, especially when we're like new to it, you know?"
"Even like, the last one, the Mach 1 AM, with the test map? It took me a like a whole week. The whole time, I didn't finish the second one. I barely finished the first one, and that was like straight to the end."
Last one [inaudible 01:59:34] a little extra credit.
I think we're done with this.
"Oh yeah, I got to get out, too."
I guess they're going to want this back.
33 out.
"Oh, and also …"
"24, 33."
Okay.
"We did last time, didn't we?"
"I don't like, lets ..."
"So, for this study, does she delete all the stuff after this class is done, or ... ?"
I'm guessing she listens to this stuff.
"That's a lot of work, man."
"Well, I guess for some, there's really nothing like us sometimes man."
I don't know.
Whatever that means.
Yeah.
And then it's us ...
"Yeah, that looks about like that should work."
"Yeah, that's awesome but ... So, you can find the maximum of the arrays by ... It's ... So that's the largest element ... Is that the same thing? It sure is. Use variables, store up [inaudible 02:15:06] ... Yes. Answer. As opposed to [inaudible 02:15:13], the largest element is fine, the smallest one is [inaudible 02:15:17] ... So, use the [inaudible 02:15:20] max to store the largest element or variable. So index the max will find?"
"Yeah, so index the max of I."
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's fine."
Someone wants to FaceTime.
"Yeah, I know."
They don't know that you're at class.
Was all over the place. Was just-
"Yeah, I'm [crosstalk 02:37:27]."
The ad [inaudible 02:37:35] they'll just use this right here. Just take the total plus equals-
Whatever.
"Oh, you did the whole [crosstalk 02:37:58]."
Oh did you? [crosstalk 02:38:06]. That's what I was going to do with one and two.
So that just pretty much just gives you the whole total and whole arrays all together. Just divided by.
No not yet.
"Is that one is, like I said, it was this right here. [crosstalk 02:38:42]. So you can find them. Do they just want the minimum? Oh yeah this one here is the maximum. [crosstalk 02:38:50]."
That's-
"No. People just went home. I almost want to do the [crosstalk 02:39:31]. I think I'm just the last two. No, no [crosstalk 02:39:36]. I got to get my extra credit."
"I think that's on remember that exit poll? [crosstalk 02:39:52]. Yeah, I don't know how to do that. That's [crosstalk 02:39:59] the ones that are hard-"
I don't know. If it's greater than the average.
"Yeah, I think this class is done after arrays."
Yeah.
"Yeah, 'cause I think chapter eight [crosstalk 02:41:45] yeah the mind goes to object in class. So [crosstalk 02:41:51]."
"Yeah, the second."
Just take it over the summer.
I'm like no. They recommend you not to take it over the summer.
"Yeah, 'cause this is pretty confusing stuff."
"Yeah. It's like great. So, one of my buddies was going to teach this stuff over the summer so I can just jump right into it in the fall. Says you can take a lady named Chow. It's an Asian lady her name is Chow."
Basically it's like a lady names Chow. She's a professor that teaches this.
"They said to take her. She's I don't know [crosstalk 02:43:01]. It's all right, it's okay. [crosstalk 02:43:05]. He says that it's pretty much the same year round."
"Pretty much they teach you bare minimum and then you just do the same thing over and over [crosstalk 02:43:16]. Yeah, so it's the same structure."
Do it with your own buddy. You have a buddy system too.
"Yeah, that's all it is. What else I do that other people who have taken other classes, or doing my RBGs and stuff, I'm like-"
... RBGs?
"I'm like, we don't even touch that."
"Yeah. That's nice. [crosstalk 02:43:46]. Its kind of weird that all the classes, it's the same class but yet they teach different materials."
I guess people will be up one I guess if they get the more advanced teacher.
I don't know. [crosstalk 02:44:15].
How'd you do on your lab test? Did you do okay?
"No, no. I was just asking-"
"I know, there's all this extra credit. I can't even look at extra credit."
"Oh yeah, I was too. I totally forgot how to do that."
"It's pretty much like [crosstalk 02:45:16] plus more. I was like, if it took me two days to do that [crosstalk 02:45:21]. Yeah, there's no way."
I bet we get back that test to one of the TAs. They'll probably end up taking them down about 30 to 45 minutes to write on.
"So for us, so it's not for us, but the students, it's going to take us two times longer [crosstalk 02:45:55] or more. At least, yeah. They can't be expecting that. It's crazy man."
"Yeah, 'cause that last lab test I made like a 78 'cause I didn't finish it."
It's so annoying.
"So you'll put, oh all of those, okay all of those into-"
"So wouldn't you just put the new array set equal to that variable? No, because ..."
"No, you can't do that 'cause they're all individual. [crosstalk 02:47:26]."
I got too much stuff to do.

Thank you. 
"All right. [crosstalk 00:00:24] Sequence of linear binary. [crosstalk 00:00:50] Came in above... What does this perform? [crosstalk 00:01:33] So, log in... Searching. The first one is searching. Did you already get that right? "
That one is searching. 
"Linear, it's... [crosstalk 00:02:32] Yeah. I agree. "
That's an odd binary because you're not dividing by two. 
Not that. Let's see. What selections were... I think she was talking about it. 
I guess that's a linear? 
I'm pretty sure it's linear. 
So four would be what? One-
77?
Wait. 
"That's, okay. "
"That's true, but it probably won't even show us. "
Makes sense. 
"It usually does, yeah. "
Should I put in the ID. 
I hope it's not us that are-
"It should... You know, we put it down there. We put, I don't know. "
I would hope so. 
Should be able to. 
I hope it's not bio stuff she's referring to. [inaudible 00:07:18]. 
"That actual index, so. "
"Yeah, that's what I got. "
"Yeah, we keep on driving it so we decided to-"
"No, it's an actual thing. "
Because the [inaudible 00:12:02]. 
What is it? So is eight return back to seven to complete this?
"Yeah, okay. I was like, ""What?"" It didn't make sense. "
"So for eight, you can compile them since it's a lot smaller."
Since it's a lot smaller. Right? Because [inaudible 00:17:14] it has to be smaller. 
Nine would be [crosstalk 00:17:24] to begin with. 
Yeah. 
"Because that's what happened because [crosstalk 00:17:34] the top, so. Somewhere between [inaudible 00:17:48], right? "
"Yeah, I think it goes back to the bottom one. Explanation of [inaudible 00:18:13]. "
Less than would be first. [crosstalk 00:24:34]
Yo. For [inaudible 00:28:43] did you get 12 or 33?
Thank you. 
At four?
"I put, you put a two, right?"
"Because then there's, this splits here. Then six is plus, so it's [crosstalk 00:29:14] the smaller half-"
[inaudible 00:30:06]. 
This looks like a [fan 00:31:53].
"I said, I just asked my [inaudible 00:31:57] on here. "
Is one... [crosstalk 00:32:04] This you should have [crosstalk 00:32:39] because we finished it. 
Okay. So that means we're done already? [crosstalk 00:33:05] 
"Yeah, that seems right. Then bubbles were, and it's-"
Because it's like three. 
So multiple on this one. 
[inaudible 00:36:57]
Bubble. [crosstalk 00:37:02] 
So what is this? Is this code referring back to-
Oh my God. 
[crosstalk 00:39:53]
This is not easy. 
This isn't easy. 
[inaudible 00:40:52]
"Yeah, it's a lot. I mean, that's a deep sort. I was like-"
I gave her... I just went to fucking 16 and had some going around-
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:41:25] I hope to God [inaudible 00:42:44]. 
[inaudible 00:46:39] the work. [crosstalk 00:46:40] 
[inaudible 00:47:55]
Taking a break. 
34
"Always fun with these. Oh yeah, that's right. Okay, so I guess, she is right, it's not that hard. Let me search how to declare it. "
"Wait, what? Correct. Generate two random numbers between... Generate two random numbers between 2 to 9 to define the dimensions of the main array. "
"Oh, okay, yeah. That makes sense."
"Nothing, basically."
"The user had to input something? Oh, I thought it was just creating two random numbers for the row and the column and then it's filling up with random..."
"Okay, that's what I thought, honestly. "
I'm turning 20. 
"So, is this the row or the column? The first one?"
Really? It's confusing. 
"So is it row first, and then column? Okay, thank you. "
"Yeah, that's..."
That's [crosstalk 00:11:43]. 
"Yeah, that's how I used the dry cleaner number."
I see how that works. 
What?
"Oh. I think I got part B to work. So it's generating a random thing so it's like... Yeah, hopefully that's right. Calculate the average-"
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
"Oh, does it have to say that?"
Calculate the average [crosstalk 00:15:53]. Data type should be this. Okay. All right. 
[inaudible 00:16:31]. Okay. 
Let's see.
"That's fine, that's fine. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. "
[crosstalk 00:24:59].
"Hmm. Plus 5, plus 8, plus 4 equals that divided by 4. What am I doing? 9, 5 plus 5, plus 8 equals that. Yeah, I have no idea. "
What part are you stuck on?
"Oh, yeah. That's how you get to every part of the array. You need a nested for loop, which is annoying. One for the column and one for the row."
"No, I mean, getting the average, that's what I'm stuck on. I don't know. "
You have to call... 
"Yeah, it would be easier if it wasn't random. There has to be a way. "
It was the second one.
What?
Average...
What are we doing wrong?
"5, 1, 7."
I don't remember. 
"Plus 6, plus 2, plus 9, plus 6, plus..."
Oh. 
How do you set what?
"Oh, so how do you put random numbers into the 2D array, is that what you're asking?"
Add the...
"Yeah, each row."
Oh.
Because you don't know how far it could go because it's random?
"I think you have to use a for loop, and then set the maximum as a random number that's generated. So let's say this number is 6, this loop will continue until it gets up to 6. The same thing for the column."
"No, wait. I think I know why it's not working, actually. [crosstalk 00:47:10] It makes sense now. Okay. "
"This needs to be a variable. Let's see if that works. No, that's the row. "
"These are actually the average of the row though, let's see."
"2, plus 5, plus 4, plus... all right, you're right, it should be less than that."
"I don't know what... this is not even the column, this is the row."
What? Because it's... 
"Yeah. And this is displaying it. I don't understand. Row, column. "
"Maybe I need to switch between... I tried that, it gave me an error. Yeah. This is right. "
"Something isn't... Actually it is... Row, column. No idea. Oh, does this need to be less than or equal to? Less than or equal to? I don't think that's it though, I'm desperate. Yeah, that's not it. "
"8. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But I don't want that, I want 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. "
Maybe I need to switch these two.
"Maybe this should be column and this should be row. That's going to give me an error, isn't it? Yeah. Wait. Yeah, it gave me an error. "
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
I think I have to save this to...
34
"Yeah, that's more confusing one. [crosstalk 00:03:44]. "
You want me to put it afterwards? 
"Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure, yeah. Instead of doing all of these [crosstalk 00:09:54]. "
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:09:54]. 
Are we still on this one too? 
"I was about to say, I'm just [crosstalk 00:17:55]. "
Nice. [crosstalk 00:25:34]. 
No. [crosstalk 00:27:49].
Yeah. because it would just be a flat line for the longest time. 
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:33:40]. 
"I thought he was having one to our guide and he used methods. I ended up putting in separate methods [crosstalk 00:42:46]. I put that [crosstalk 00:43:01] because I know how to do that, but I'm not sure about those parts. "
"You know what we're supposed to do right? How many rows, columns, then the user inputs the- "
I just can't figure out how to put this into it with no method. It's so hard. [crosstalk 00:43:28]. 
I wonder if you can return the method. I mean return the no Raytheon method. [crosstalk 00:43:54]. 
Lets see if that works. 
"Name, [crosstalk 00:44:19]. "
It's not working. It won't let me [crosstalk 00:49:45] I don't understand how long it said [crosstalk 00:49:45]. 
So how's [crosstalk 00:49:45]. 
I think so yeah. That's how they take their 10 minutes. [crosstalk 00:50:53]. 
"I think so. He texted me a couple days ago, but he isn't going to go and he wanted me to send him the code, but he didn't do that this morning. [crosstalk 00:52:03]. It's too late to drop out right of the class? [crosstalk 00:52:08]. Well, he wasn't in the lab the other- "
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:52:20]. Yeah. He can't miss the class because he's so behind [crosstalk 00:52:32]. 
I'm just going to start on problem two because it's taking too much time. [crosstalk 00:52:55]. 
"Yeah, well, the current method that [crosstalk 00:53:12]. Okay, I need help on this part. Isn't this supposed to have two methods? [crosstalk 00:53:44]. I knew how to do the method for the average, but I didn't know how to do it [crosstalk 00:53:50]. "
Can I [crosstalk 00:53:58]. 
I didn't know you could return ... I just messed up on this part because you were supposed to put these fractions I guess. [crosstalk 00:57:04]. So that makes problems here a lot easier because I know how to put in a [crosstalk 00:57:32]. You want me to send you the code for this? 
Whenever you want the code you can just ask. [crosstalk 00:58:27]. Huh? 
I thought so to but apparently [crosstalk 00:59:59]. Isn't there one where like each character go as an integer but one equals A or something? [crosstalk 01:00:13]. 
"I think so. [crosstalk 01:00:13]. Yeah, I think you're right that you can't put a jar in it. "
"Actually no, you can just put a jar in it because [crosstalk 01:00:52]- "
34
Yeah. I'm turning right now. [crosstalk 00:09:29]. I got [crosstalk 00:09:36].
"What? Yeah, I finished. I couldn't do the second, extra credit. That was too hard. I was like oh, I'll just turn it in."
Yeah. It was really hard.
Yeah.
How do I make it so if the user pressed enter...
That's fine. The extra [crosstalk 00:23:28].
"This sucks. I can't find the logic for a search in... I sort of got this blank part right, but sometimes it gives me an error. [crosstalk 00:44:33]."
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe we need to save I. [crosstalk 00:45:48].
