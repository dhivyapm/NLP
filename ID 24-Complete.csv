[inaudible 00:01:02] Marco.
"Let's try the functions first, and then we could just input the inputs, or."
"No, I was just saying it like the flow chart."
"Where it's like, enter the length of your sides, and then-[crosstalk 00:04:30]."
"Is it? Or ... I thought it was supposed to be like, figure it out."
"Oh yeah, nevermind, sorry."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And for the second program, for ... I mean, I guess, Problem 10 is basically just checking, just using a ... What is it, a remainder?"
"Like a modulus, to check if it's like a-[crosstalk 00:07:46]."
"Yeah, part two."
I kind of just been working on the assignment. Hopefully I can get it finished by the time I get home.
That way I don't have to worry about it.
Yeah.
"That way I can just start, like really study for this test that's coming up in two weeks."
"They said the lab test is going to be next Friday, or was it going to be the Friday after that?"
All right. I have to start practicing with the examples I have [inaudible 00:08:48] and start asking questions when they get back on Monday.
"Do you, have you met her ... With her with, in her office?"
Marcin? No?
Oh.
I really do. I'm just ... Eh.
"No, I was thinking about something else."
"What did you do for the, did you have to go to that thing we had to do for 2,600?"
Yeah.
How did you feel about that?
I can imagine you just acting out.
I got into it.
"I did pretty well at it, I guess my group was really into it. There was a lot of people that were acting like animals, and I was like, ""Dang."""
Yeah.
"So methods is just making this small programs, inside your program?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, when are they called? Have you put that in yet?"
Yes.
"But you named it, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm seeing that."
Interesting.
You're?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I think you just enter in a number, and see if it's a even or an odd."
"You just, you ask, please enter your number, and then you have an input integer, and then a variable of the integer being input into it, and then you put ... You kind of make a method like check what's odd or even, and inside that you would put the modulus of the number that will input it like the X, and then you return whether it's even or odd."
"You would put the if statement in the method, or would you put that outside?"
"Would you put the if statement inside the method, or would you put that on the..."
"Nevermind. You would put it outside, right?"
"Okay. You put the modulus ... You're going to put the, whatever, you put the modulus inside the method right?"
To get the remainder?
"Right? And then you would get like, if the remainder is odd-[crosstalk 00:17:32] or even you could-."
"All right, cool."
The what?
Number check.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"You would write it out, and then you would put post static double. No, post static integer."
"Well, what was even or odd is that."
It's a string?
Yeah.
Yeah.
A integer.
Yeah.
It's an even.
Is that it?
You okay? You dropped your phone.
So you're going backwards?
Because double equals mod?
Cool.
That should be it.
"No, I'm good. I'll just do it at home. I'll just do it at home because I want to kind of go through the book."
I really just skimmed like the Chapter 6. I'd feel better if I just read through the book.
Just try to do it.
"I don't know, I kind of just skim it. When I have time I try to read it, but I wasn't ... I haven't had time in a while."
The one that's due ... The assignment?
"Assignment. Oh, this activity. Yeah, well, I do it while I read the book."
"Yeah, because then I'm kind of going like what am I doing wrong? And then I just."
"I feel like most of the stuff that she assigns us, you can go through the book, and just find out about it."
That was weird.
"Yeah, it was in the book, it was just worded weird."
"So do you just look online for most of your information, or do you kind of just figure it out? Did you say you don't read the book?"
I've done functions and like C Sharp as well as-[crosstalk 00:25:22].
With methods.
But what do you mean? What do you mean about modifiers?
What do you mean modifiers?
That's good. What's your second one?
What's the second one you're going to take?
"Oh, yeah."
"Really? I was thinking about it, but then I was wondering if there would be enough time for me to actually learn through it all."
That's three hours.
How many days is it?
"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at eight."
Dang.
What does the second class cover? Is it just more on Java?
Ah.
I think the exit form is already posted.
"The sporadic reasoning? I'm doing the paper, and then I'm just going to try to modify the PDF so I could send it to him today."
Are you ... Is what you doing?
You're not?
Ah.
I must say positive.
"I think it's because we had the ... With the little thing on it, little microphone."
I hope not.
Can we go? Yeah.
Goodbye.










So what she meant when like you are missing some numbers. You are just swapping them.
A little bit.
Is that what she meant with the letters?
No just ...
"No. Yeah, that will be a lot more."
Better idea than just pulling.
It's just that heavy cord.
"No, just tell Chris that..."
"Well, I'm done."
No.
"No, I'm fine. I'll do it. Yeah."
You really can't move with this on.
24 is taking this off.
I think we have to wear it until Chris takes it off of us.
24
24
Did you see it yet?
[crosstalk 00:03:54].
"Yeah. I got my English... Well, I haven't been able to get my math yet but I'm going to go talk to my advisor tomorrow to see specifically what math I need."
I think the exit form is up.
I'm going to go.










24
Yeah.
It's not my computer. My brother did it.
Actually I have a [inaudible 00:01:48]
Right there?
Just wait a second... till I reach that point.
How do you do [crosstalk 00:10:13]?
I'm doing good. I don't know how... I'm having trouble with the... I didn't know they could be so hard.
Yeah.
Yeah. And then they don't match at all.
Oh. That's neat.
Cool.
"You create the matrix then you loop it 5 times, then you would get the columns and then you would get the random number between 0 and 9. It would be the columns."
"Then you assign that to one then you print that matrix, then you would loop it 5 times. And then you would search through each of those numbers to see if..."
That would then print 5 different matrix. That would be the loop 5 times.
And then a second method would be to search the matrix and then see if the matrix x and y match then it's true you win. If not it's false.
"So you'd have to search through but since you've already assigned it to a specific index, the first index."
No.
"But I think yours is faster, wouldn't it?"
Because its longer if you're checking through the index and seeing if they match. It's awesome.
I think I'm going to try that.
"I'm going to do it the way that she did it first and then submit that and then try to do it the way that you did it. Since I have a free day tomorrow, I'll just try to do that."
I have a free day tomorrow.
"No. I got time off work. Where I only have to work on Monday, Tuesdays and Thursdays. So I have to work on Wednesdays and Fridays so they say I've to spend time to study for projects and exams."
I work at this textile mill.
"It pays the bills and car insurance. Commuting. So yeah. I can't complain about that. It pays for things, I think I'm fine. I can't complain too much."
I'll see you tomorrow.
No. I'm going to do it now.
